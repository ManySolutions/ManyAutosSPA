                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Timing Belt is a rubber belt which controls the timing of internal
                  combustion engines. It is vital in the process of making the car run smoothly as it also ensures the
                  crankshaft and camshaft rotate in synchronisation.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">A snapped timing/cam belt is uncommon however tension issues are
                  more widespread.
                  If the belt is too loose it will end up whipping around inside the engine which will cause a variety
                  of knock on effects and if the belt is too tight it will put a strain on the bearings of the cogs,
                  it's fitted to.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">A tight belt will cause a whining noise to be emitted from the
                  engine so if you hear this sound make sure to book a repair as soon as possible. You shouldn’t wait
                  until this happens though, as the damage caused by a faulty cambelt will end up costing you even more
                  money in repairs.</p>

                What Happens If Your Timing Belt Snaps?
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">The most difficult aspect of your timing belt maintenance is that
                  it will usually continue to give dependable service, with minimal attention, for several years.
                  But rubber is, of course, a perishable item, and the constant exposure to the high temperatures found
                  in an engine, together with the speeds at which the belt has to constantly rotate, means the timing
                  belt has to work really hard to keep everything running harmoniously.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">If your timing belt snaps, there are two likely scenarios, which
                  will depend on the type of engine timing configuration employed.<br>So-called ‘interference’ engines
                  need the cam belt to prevent the valves and pistons inside your engine from smashing into each other
                  at high speed. And of course, if they were to do this, it’s likely to result in the respective parts
                  being smashed to pieces and distributing the resulting debris all over the inside of your engine, so
                  unleashing all kinds of mayhem which can cause damage way beyond the individual components involved.
                </p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">If your car has a non-interference engine, the pistons and valves
                  are housed separately, so a snapped timing belt shouldn’t cause any damage to them, and a repair can
                  be made simply by fitting a new belt. However, your car will still be immobilised if the belt snaps,
                  which could result in you having to pay to have it towed to a garage if you don’t have the benefit of
                  membership of a recovery service.</p>

                What’s the Lifespan of A Typical Cam Belt?
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">As a rule, you can expect a timing belt to last up to five years,
                  or 60,000 miles. In cars where this replacement is needed, it is usually built into the servicing
                  schedule.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Your first resort for checking the manufacturer’s recommended
                  intervals for cam belt changes is your car’s manual. Of course, if you didn’t get one when you bought
                  the car, you should take a look at your manufacturer’s website, as this often contains full details of
                  servicing and maintenance schedules, on which the replacement will be flagged.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">In any case, if you’ve stayed within the mileage mentioned above,
                  you should be prepared to have the belt replaced in the run-up to your car’s fifth birthday, and every
                  five years after that.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">A replacement timing belt will be a relatively modest cost on the
                  menu of a typical car service, especially if carried out as part of a scheduled maintenance programme.
                </p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">But as we’ve already seen, it’s the consequential damage of a
                  failure which can prove catastrophic and costly. So, you should establish as soon as you can after
                  taking ownership of a car what the recommended interval for having it changed is, and whether or not,
                  and when, it has been changed in the past.<br>But importantly, because the belt must be fitted and
                  remain in perfect synchronisation with other engine parts, it’s a repair which is best done by a
                  mechanical expert.<br>So whether you have your car serviced by a franchised dealer or an independent
                  garage, you should work closely with them to make sure you know when the job needs to be done, and
                  certainly not be tempted to skip having it looked at the appropriate time. Make a note of it in your
                  car manual, or on a calendar, and once you get into the habit, like plenty of other car maintenance
                  tasks, it will soon become second nature.</p>
