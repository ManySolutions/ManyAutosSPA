                Rear Coil springs absorb vibrations and bumps on the road, delivering a smoother ride for you and your
                passengers. If you need coil spring replacements, an integral part of a car's suspension, coil springs
                have been designed to absorb shock. As you travel, your vehicle will come across plenty of bumps in the
                road - and it's a coil spring's job to make sure you hardly feel the effects. Over time, coil springs
                can lose their elasticity. This happens with general wear and tear, and for the most comfortable ride
                possible it's best to replace them.

                Rear Shock Absorbers For the optimum in smooth rides and comfortable journeys, it can be worth updating
                your shock absorbers, the job of the shock absorber is a simple one - to keep you as steady on the road
                as possible. When there are the inevitable bumps and potholes to deal with, it’s the shock absorbers
                that keep your wheels tight to the road, working with the suspension system to even out surfaces and
                keep you on the straight and narrow. It could be time to upgrade your absorbers if you feel that your
                car isn’t handling as well as it used to, or if you arrive feeling like you’ve felt every inch of the
                road surface beneath you as you’ve travelled.

                The Rear suspension mounting in your car improves the link between the chassis and the shock absorber to
                give a smoother ride. Just a simple component, the small mounting plate itself is one of the most
                important parts of your car’s whole suspension system and can cause significant and costly damage to
                your vehicle if it fails. Your car has two or four mounting points, depending on whether it has two- or
                four-wheel independent suspension. The suspension mounting is attached by a circular metal plate that is
                bolted securely into place at several points. It is located above the two front wheels, to either side
                of the motor, and, in the case of four-wheel independent suspension, also close to both rear wheel wells
                where the mounting meets the suspension. Being the part that absorbs all the bumps and vibrations while
                driving, the suspension mounting is put under intense strain and can become easily worn or damaged as a
                result. Symptoms of a defective mount include poor handling, hard or noisy steering, instability when
                cornering and uneven wheel alignment. A fully functional suspension mounting will improve the lifespan
                of shock absorbers and other vital suspension parts such as tyres. Checking the mounting regularly is an
                essential part of car maintenance and replacing mounts when worn is a small price to pay to ensure the
                safety and handling of your car remains intact. Replace both or all four mountings together to ensure
                even wear.

                Rear Axle Carriers For a truly safe drive, it’s important to keep an eye on your rear axle carriers.
                Unfortunately, the nature of this car part means that they can be easily damaged often just by hitting
                the curb but even without any kind of impact, they do experience damage over time. It’s because of this
                that you should keep an eye on your axle carriers and look to replace them when they do become worn
                beyond use. Updating these will not only help your car spread its load and reduce the vibration
                experienced by the rear axle carriers, but they’ll contribute to the safe and sensible running of your
                car. A study of axle system noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) performance using design for six sigma
                (DFSS) methods is presented with a focus on system robustness to typical product variations
                manufacturing based tolerances. Instead of using finite element analysis as the simulation tool, a
                lumped parameter system dynamics model developed in Simulink is used in the study. This provides an
                efficient way to conduct large analytical design of experiment and stochastic studies. The model's
                capability to predict both nominal and variance performance is validated with vehicle test data using
                statistical hypothesis test methods. Major driveline system variables that contribute to axle gear noise
                are identified and their variation distributions in production are obtained through sampling techniques.
                Through analytical DOE and analysis of variance analyses, the critical design parameters that control
                system NVH variations with respect to product variations and variations due to operating conditions are
                covered. Design criteria of axle systems with respect to robust NVH performance are also discussed.
