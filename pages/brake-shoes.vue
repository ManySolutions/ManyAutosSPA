              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">A worn or damaged brake shoe is a safety risk to yourself and other
                road users, and should be replaced every 50,000 miles. The job of the brake shoe is to produce the
                friction needed to slow and stop the car. It consists of a curved surface of steel covered on one side
                with an abrasive lining material. Brake shoes are to drum brakes what brake pads are to disc brakes.
                Disc brake systems can cope with higher temperatures than drum brake systems, but brake shoes are
                cheaper than brake pads. While brake pads can be bought with a choice of friction materials to suit
                different driving habits, brake shoes use a generic material and will perish more quickly if you are
                prone to excessive or hard braking. Itâ€™s advisable to replace your brake shoes in sets to ensure even
                wear.</p>

                Brake shoes are used in drum brake systems, with the lined shoe pressing against the inside of the drum
                to stop it moving. The drum is attached to the wheel, making it a pretty clever way of getting the car
                to stop. Brakes are something which can't be neglected - they're by far the least painful way of
                stopping from speed, so you need to make sure they're kept in good working order. We're here to help
                make the process of getting replacement parts easy, with a wide choice of brake shoes and drum brakes
                for a wide selection of car makes and models.

                If your car has brake drums (usually older cars have drums at the rear), it will have brake shoes which
                are situated inside the drum. The brake shoes will press against the inside of the drums when braking,
                causing friction and eventually slowing the car down.

                When should you consider replacing a Brake Shoe?

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Over time, the brake shoes can wear out due to the friction that it has to endure each time you brake.
                Brake shoes can wear to such an extent that the rivets holding the friction plate to the rest of the
                shoe can get exposed. Each time you brake in this scenario the rivets can potentially score the contact
                surface inside the drum. Thus, damaging the brake drum as well, which in that case would have to be
                replaced too to ensure effective braking. Servicing the brake shoes is therefore key to ensure a long
                lifespan for the brakes. Always service the brakes as and when stipulated in the guidelines set out by
                your car's manufacturer. In cases that the brake shoes are damaged or have worn out prematurely it is
                important you have the shoes (and the brake drums) inspected and, if necessary, replaced as soon as
                possible.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                The main difference between the two different types of brake pads and shoes is their position in the
                vehicle. The brake shoes are designed to fit inside your drum-style brakes, while brake shoes are placed
                on top of disk brakes, and serve to pressurize these discs when you apply the brakes.

                When using drum brakes, you need to have a rear or four-wheel drive if you have front wheel drive cars,
                then you'll typically need to have brake pads disc than shoes. If you have drum brakes then you can't
                use brake pads, nor can you use brake shoes with disc brakes.

                it may not be necessary to replace both.

                When the brake is applied, the shoe moves and presses the lining against the inside of the drum. The
                friction between lining and drum provides the braking effort. Energy is dissipated as heat. Modern cars
                have disc brakes all round, or discs at the front and drums at the rear.
