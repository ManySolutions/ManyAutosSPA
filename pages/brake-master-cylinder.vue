              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Given that the master cylinder will wear through normal use and can
                become corroded over time, its essential to replace it in order to avoid the risk of brake failure. A
                vital part of your cars braking system, the master cylinder converts the pressure created by your foot
                pressing down on the brake pedal into hydraulic pressure, which builds up as brake fluid becomes
                trapped. This hydraulic pressure sets the whole braking mechanism into action, ending with the wheel
                cylinders demobilising the wheels. The master cylinder is a complicated piece of machinery, itself
                having several components. These include the housing, bore, brake fluid reservoir, fluid level sensor,
                piston(s), rubber cap, return spring and, in a manual car, rubber boot. Hydraulic pressure is instigated
                when the spring, cup and pistons slide in the cylinder bore. As an extra safety measure, modern vehicles
                usually have dual master cylinders, each with a different system of brake-circuit operation. If one
                cylinder fails (perhaps through the loss of brake fluid), the other will be able to work alone until the
                malfunctioning cylinder can be replaced. A common cause of failure is contamination or loss of brake
                fluid; if brake fluid becomes hygroscopic (attracting water), it will affect the system.</p>

                How Does Brake Master Cylinders It Work?

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                The brake master cylinder is the hydraulic pressure part of the brake system which holds brake fluid in
                a reservoir. When you push the brake pedal down the plunger inside the brake master cylinder housing is
                forced forward which transfers pressurized fluid to the brake calipers or wheel cylinders which then
                actuates the brake system to slow the car down. The master cylinder is divided into two separate
                sections, a primary and secondary pressure system. This safety system was created inside the master
                cylinder so if one half of the brake system fails the car will still have the remaining half to help
                slow the vehicle. This safety is divided into front or rear brakes.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                The master cylinder is constructed with rubber seals which in time can go bad and allow the brake fluid
                to bypass internally or leak out from the rear of the master. When the brake master goes bad the brake
                pedal will sink and the brake warning light will come on. This condition will greatly decrease the
                stopping ability of the car. Inspect for brake fluid leakage around the master cylinder and check the
                fluid level regularly. If leakage is present replace master cylinder immediately. If the master cylinder
                actuator rod is adjusted to far out it will not allow the brake master plunger to fully return creating
                residual brake pressure which causes the brakes to lock up and not allow the car to roll. There must be
                1/16 of an inch or 1.5 mm clearance between the master cylinder and the brake booster or pedal rod.

                Most of the time, if a brake component needs replacing, it leaves a trail to follow. This trail is made
                of stinky brake fluid. That's the good news. Following a trail of brake fluid will usually lead you to a
                current or future brake problem. There are lots of brake components that can go bad. You've got wheel
                cylinders, master cylinders, discs, boosters, ABS systems and even brake pads. Any of these things can
                make your brakes more exciting than you ever hoped. Excitement is not something we want out of our
                brakes.

                Symptoms of Bad Brake Master Cylinder
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">When you step on the brake pedal in a vehicle to slow it down, its
                  braking system uses a brake master cylinder to convert the pressure you place on the pedal into
                  hydraulic pressure. The conversion of the pressure takes place because the brake master cylinder
                  transfers brake fluid to the braking circuit as you step on the brake pedal. The brake master cylinder
                  will do this no matter if your vehicle is using disc brakes or drum brakes. There is no way any
                  braking system could exist without a brake master cylinder. Warning Light The first symptom that is
                  the easiest to notice is when the Brake Warning Light illuminates on the dashboard. This indicates
                  that there is problem with the braking system, so it might not necessarily mean that the brake master
                  cylinder is at fault. But if the braking system sensors detect the brake fluid pressure is dropping,
                  it will likely be due to a bad brake master cylinder. This will result in the warning light coming on.
                  Leaky Brake Fluid The brake master cylinder needs a certain level of braking fluid to create the
                  hydraulic pressure necessary for slowing down the vehicle. If the brake master cylinder is leaking
                  braking fluid or if there are unsecured reservoirs on the cylinder which are holding the fluid, then
                  you will have a low brake fluid level for sure. This will impair your ability to slow down the
                  vehicle. You would need to replace the brake master cylinder in this situation. Spongy Brake Pedal
                  When the brake pedal starts to feel spongy as you place pressure on it with your foot, this will
                  automatically be a sign that your brake master cylinder is having issues. The cylinder contains rubber
                  seals which keep the brake fluid inside of it. If these rubber seals were to get worn out or damaged,
                  then there will be an internal brake fluid leak. The result of this would be a spongy feeling in the
                  brake pedal. Contaminated Brake Fluid. Another problem that could happen as a result of worn out
                  rubber seals is contamination in the brake fluid. The seals not only help keep the brake fluid from
                  coming out, they also prevent dirt and debris from mixing with the brake fluid. If this were to
                  happen, the brake pressure would not be as strong as you step on the brake pedal. You'd probably end
                  up pressing down harder on the pedal just to get the vehicle to slow down like normal. Sinking Brake
                  Pedal. Following all these other symptoms, you will start noticing the brake pedal not returning to
                  the top after you have removed your foot from it. Instead, it will slowly sink to the floor. This
                  could become a real driving hazard, so you wll want to fix the brake master cylinder right away at
                  this point.</p>
