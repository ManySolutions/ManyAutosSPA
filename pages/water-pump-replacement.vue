              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">When you are travelling on the road, your engine reaches very high
                temperatures. Water pumps work by pumping water through the engine from the radiator, which is then
                recycled back through the coolant system. A water pump gasket works as a seal between the engine and the
                water pump to prevent leaking and is fundamental to the cooling process. If your engine begins to leak
                coolant, it is vital that you get your gasket replaced promptly to prevent further damage to your
                engine. A visible sign of a coolant leak is a pool of water under your vehicle. Additionally, corrosion
                and wear with age and use can cause a gasket to fail, which can cause overheating and water leakage into
                the oil compartment.</p>

                Problems Caused by A Car Water Pump Leak

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">The car water pump on any vehicle is vital which is why we work
                  hard to make sure you can get trustworthy water pump price quotes from us. The car pump feeds the
                  engine with a constant supply of coolant from its radiator, which helps keep it at a constant
                  temperature and in turn ensures that all parts run smoothly.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">A water pump leak or other failure can quickly cause your engine
                  itself to fail completely. The result - a very expensive, and inconvenient, repair job, or even the
                  need for a new car.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">We may have seen huge improvements in engine materials and
                  technology over the years, but it remains as vital that your car water pump properly circulates
                  coolant through the engine block as it does and that you keep the oil level in your engine topped up.
                </p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Although the water pump for cars, vans and SUVs will last a long
                  time, the components are by no means indestructible. It’s quite possible for a water pump leak to
                  develop, and this will soon result in damage to other parts of your engine - and potentially huge
                  expense.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Over time, components of the water pump can wear out, either
                  leading to leaks or a reduced pumping capacity. In most cases it is one of the seals that leak, in
                  others the rotating part of the pump might have been damaged. In the worst-case scenario, the pump
                  will not pump any coolant through the system which can lead to the car overheating which, ultimately,
                  can lead to severe engine damage.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Should you experience problems with the pump like those listed
                  earlier, then it is advisable to have the water pump inspected and, if necessary, have it replaced.
                  Seeing that the water pump is a component that is especially prone to wear it should always be
                  serviced as and when stipulated in the guidelines set out by your car's manufacturer.</p>

                However, mechanics often replace water pumps before they fail. A water pump should last 60,000 to 90,000
                miles, about the same amount of time as a timing belt.

                Most of the time, the problem with a water pump pulley is not the pulley itself, but the bearings inside
                the pulley. When the bearings wear out, it will create a metal-to-metal grinding sound which is commonly
                due to lack of lubrication or a faulty bearing.

                Generally, the idler pulleys, tensioner and water pump should always be replaced when the timing belt is
                replaced. In most cases, the timing belt drives the water pump, so it is the right time to replace the
                water pump. It is also recommended by the manufacturer.
