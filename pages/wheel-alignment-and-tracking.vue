                prolong the life of your tyre, increase fuel efficiency and fix steering issues. Many Autos wheel
                alignment check to ensure your wheels are properly aligned and reduce the likelihood of steering and
                suspension issues. Using laser alignment technology, our technicians will assess the primary alignment

                Why wheel alignment is important
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Wheel alignment, or tracking, is the process of ensuring your vehicle’s wheels are set to the optimum
                position, as per the car manufacturer’s specifications. Incorrect alignment can result in rapid and
                irregular tyre wear and can even affect the handling and safety of the vehicle. Wheel alignment problems
                can be caused by hitting a kerb, driving into a pothole in the road or by excessive wear to steering or
                suspension components. It is important to get your wheel alignment checked regularly to ensure you get
                the most out of your tyres. Keep an eye out for unusual wear on your tyres, such as premature wear on
                the inside or outside shoulder, which could be a sign of incorrect alignment. The wheel aligner is
                renowned for its accuracy and uses a series of high definition imaging sensors which measure 14 primary
                alignment angles on your vehicle. these include Camber, Caster, Thrust Line, Toe in and Toe out. The
                position and orientation of your car wheels are compared against the manufacturer data for your vehicle,
                ensuring the vehicle is set up perfectly for you to drive. Regular wheel alignment can reduce uneven
                tyre wear, improve vehicle handling and steering and save you money by lowering fuel consumption.

                What is wheel alignment?
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                If your front wheels are out of alignment, it means that they are not fitted into the correct position
                and do not point in the exact same direction. If the front wheels are not aligned, your car will be more
                difficult to steer, and a range of other issues may arise as a result. Getting your front wheels aligned
                is not a costly service and does not take a huge amount of time. However, if you ignore the issue, you
                will likely cause damage to your steering and suspension. Front wheel alignment is a service which is
                carried out on the front wheels of a car exclusively. The service is completed by moving the car into
                position where a machine in a garage can determine whether the front wheels are pointing in the exact
                same direction. It is critical that they are because a range of problems will arise if the front wheels
                of your car are not aligned. Front wheels are more likely to be knocked out of alignment because of an
                impact as they take the biggest brunt of speed bumps and hitting curbs. 4-wheel alignment is a service
                in which every wheel of a car has its alignment checked. A mechanic will make use of a specialist
                machine to check to see if all the wheels are pointing in the correct direction. If they are not, the
                same machine will manipulate the wheels to resolve the issue. One of the most obvious signs that your
                front wheels need aligning is that your steering wheel will be shaking. Even a slight vibration is a
                tell-tale sign and as soon as you feel a change in the steering wheel, you should take your car in for a
                check.

                How do you know if your car needs an alignment?

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Here are some common signs that you are dealing with wheels with poor alignment: 1. Vehicle pulling to
                the left or right. 2. Uneven or rapid tyre wear. 3. Your steering wheel is crooked when driving
                straight. 4. Squealing tires.

                Tracking on the fronts (sometimes called a two-wheel alignment) does not take in account the direction
                in which the rear wheels are pointing. With such accurate readings, Four Wheel Alignment allows toe
                adjustments of individual wheels which ensure the steering wheel is set straight.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Often, the wheel alignment is recommended when new tyre are installed. The alignment should be done more
                often if your car has wider tires or if it's a sporty car.

                If your vehicle tracks as straight as an arrow, you're wheels likely are properly aligned. Even so, it's
                a good idea to have your alignment checked, such as when you have your tyres rotated. You certainly
                should have it done when you buy new tyres, so they don't immediately start to wear unevenly.
