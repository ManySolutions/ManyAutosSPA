              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">For your safety and that of other road users, you must replace your
                handbrake drum as soon as it starts to show signs of wear. The drum is fundamental to your handbrake
                system. In fact, all parts in the handbrake system work together to help you control the drum and to
                keep it in place when required. The handbrake drum is a metal cylinder which connects to the handbrake
                lever via a series of cables. When you pull up the handbrake lever, the cables push brake shoes inside
                the drum to create resistance, thus stopping the rear wheels from moving. If disc brakes are installed
                on the rear wheels, then your parking brake uses its own drum. In this case, the drum will be built into
                your disc brake system. If your brake drum needs replacing, it may display a couple of symptoms. If your
                car still rolls when you engage your handbrake, or there is too much play in the brake lever, these are
                key signs that you need a new drum. While it is true that a defective handbrake drum won’t keep you from
                driving your car, it is in the interests of safety that you replace it immediately.</p>

                vehicle and has the lining positioned differently from the secondary shoe.

                brake drum. Look through one of the holes in the top of one of the rear wheels.

                Quite literally a drum brake is a small round drum that has a set of shoes inside of it. The drum brake
                will rotate alongside the wheel and when the brake pedal is applied, the shoes are forced against the
                sides of the drum and the wheel is slowed. A disc brake has a disc shaped metal rotor spinning within a
                wheel.

                How You Know When Drum Brakes Fail
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                There are two basic ways to tell when drum brakes are not working effectively and need either to be
                repaired or replaced. The first is by listening. As brake shoes wear down, they start to squeal each
                time you apply the brakes. This may either indicate the need to resurface the interior of the drums or
                replace the shoes. Another noise that you do not want to hear is grinding. Grinding means that metal is
                rubbing against metal. The shoes have worn down sufficiently to be digging into the interior of the
                drum. At worst, both shoes and drums will have to be replaced when this happens. At best, the shoes will
                need replacing and the drums will need resurfacing. The other way you can tell your brake drums need
                work is by the way the pedal feels when you apply it. Due to the way that the shoes are compressed into
                the drums, they do not necessarily wear evenly. This eventually causes the interior of the drums to get
                “out of round.” In other words, the interior of the drum is no longer a perfect circle. Each time you
                press the brakes, you feel this unevenness as the shoes rub against the inside of the drum. This tells
                you that the drums need resurfacing although not necessarily replacement. It is important to take care
                of the brakes as soon as you know something is wrong. Not to do so can lead to increased repair or
                replacement costs in the near future as well as increased stopping time and the potential for a serious
                accident.

                How Brake Drums Work and When to Change Your Brake Drums
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                On most cars, brake drums are found in the rear wheels. This is primarily because of their relatively
                low cost and the ability for a parking brake to adhere to them. Like all brake system components in a
                car, they wear down from time to time and need to be replaced. Since the brakes are arguably the car’s
                most vital safety feature, brake parts should never be allowed to fail. Rather, timely repair or
                replacement is always the best course of action. There are two tell-tale signs that your brake drums
                need to be replaced, indicated by noise and feeling. How Brake Drums Work Brake drums consist of the
                outer layer of the drum, two brake shoes, a wheel cylinder containing two pistons, and an adjuster arm.
                When you press down on the brake pedal, it compresses brake fluid which in turn puts pressure on the
                individual wheel cylinder. The pressure forces the pistons out which pushes the brake shoes up against
                the interior lining of the drum. The adjuster arm allows the shoes to be pushed into the drum with more
                force while also spreading out the surface contact. Numerous springs are found inside of the drum which
                pull the shoes off the interior once braking is complete. It also controls the adjuster arm and position
                of the shoes.
