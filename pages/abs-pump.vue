                from locking. Your carâ€™s ABS Pump receives commands from the ABS controller. This in turn obtains
                speed-related data from sensor rings on each wheel. When the sensor ring detects that one of your wheels
                is spinning at a different speed than the others, the controller tells the ABS hydraulic unit to close
                the solenoid valve. This then reduces the braking force on the offending wheel and stops it from locking
                for more than a nanosecond. A faulty ABS hydraulic unit could cause your car to fail its MOT. If your
                wheels are locking and you see a warning light appear on the dashboard, it could be that your ABS
                hydraulic unit is not working as it should.</p>

                The ABS System. Anti-lock brake pump and valves. The theory behind anti-lock brakes is simple.
                A skidding wheel (where the tire contact patch is sliding relative to the road) has less traction than a
                non-skidding wheel.

                additional safety feature found
                on many modern vehicles. When the ABS system is not functioning then loss of traction, skidding, and
                hydroplaning are far more likely to occur under heavy braking conditions.

                The ABS System and How It Works
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                The Anti-Lock Braking System or Anti-Skid Braking System is commonly abbreviated as ABS and is an
                advanced braking technology installed on motor vehicles to prevent the wheels from locking up (ceasing
                motion) and skidding uncontrollably. It does so by pulsating the braking force delivered to the wheels
                similar to threshold braking, which is a technique commonly used in motor racing and the idea is to
                control the brake pedal pressure and apply maximum braking force to a point just before the wheels are
                about to slip. The ABS system improves vehicle control and will greatly reduce the stopping distance on
                dry and slippery surfaces, however, it can significantly increase the stopping distance on loose gravel
                and snow-covered roads where traction between the tyres and road surface is limited. ESP (Electronic
                Stability Control) works seamlessly integrated with ABS to further maintain tractive contact with the
                road surface by electronically controlling the front-to-rear brake bias. The ESP system, depending on
                the specific capabilities and implementation is also known as Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD),
                Traction Control System (TCS), Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Dynamic Traction Control (DTC).

                The wheel speed sensor is used to determine the acceleration or deceleration of the wheel. These sensors
                use an ABS ring which spins with the wheel and differential and creates a magnetic field around the
                wheel speed sensor, which in turn will generate the voltage in the sensor.

                ABS Hydraulic Valves
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                In each of the brake lines, there is a hydraulic valve which is controlled by the ABS module. On some
                setups, the valve will have three positions. Position One The valve is open and any pressure from the
                brake master cylinder passes directly through to the brake. Position Two The valve is closed, blocking
                the brake line and isolating the brake from the master cylinder. This prevents the pressure from rising
                further if the driver presses harder on the brake pedal. Position Three The valve opens partially,
                releasing some of the pressure from the brake. The majority of issues with the valve system occur
                because of clogged valves. A clogged inoperable valve will be unable to open, close or change position
                and the system will fail in trying to modulate the valves and control the pressure supplied to the
                brakes.

                The pump in the ABS unit is used to restore the loss in pressure to the hydraulic brakes after the
                hydraulic valves have released it. Signals from the wheel speed sensors are processed by the ABS ECU
                Module and if a wheel slip is detected, the module will signal the valve to be released to avoid the
                wheel slip. After the valve is released and pressure lost, the pump is used to restore the lost pressure
                to the braking system. The ABS controller will modulate the pumps status to control the and provide the
                desired amount of pressure and reduce slipping.

                sensors and can interpret the information received to identify if there is a wheel slip on any one
                wheel. If a wheel spin is detected and a wheel loses traction, the controller will limit the braking
                force (EBD) and send the signal to actuate the hydraulic braking valves on and off.
