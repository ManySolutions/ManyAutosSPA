              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                A malfunctioning fuel pump tends to deliver too much or too little fuel from the petrol or diesel tank,
                which can cause your vehicle to breakdown. To ensure your vehicle always drives as it should. Mechanical
                fuel pumps resemble diaphragms and sit on a mount outside of the fuel tanks of older vehicles. Most
                modern vehicles use an electronic fuel pump, which you will find in the fuel tank itself. Whereas
                electronic variants deliver greater performance, they are prone to more issues. This is because both the
                pump and the computer that your car uses to control it can malfunction. There are a few symptoms of a
                faulty fuel pump to look out for. If your vehicle sputters at high speed or loses power while under
                stress or even just when you accelerate, these are key signs that you need to replace the pump in your
                car. If your car suffers from any of these symptoms, get it checked and change your fuel pump as soon as
                possible to avoid costly repairs. As a vital part of the fuel delivery system, buying a good quality
                fuel pump will help ensure that your car continues to run smoothly.

                What does a Fuel Pump do?
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                The fuel pump is part of the engine's fuel system and serves to supply fuel to the engine for combustion
                at the level required by the engine. In most cars, the pump is usually located near or in the fuel tank.

                When should you consider a Fuel Pump replacement?
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Over time, due to continuous use, the fuel pump can wear and eventually fail leading to an unstable flow
                of fuel being directed towards the engine. Depending on whether the car has a mechanical or an
                electronic fuel pump several issues can arise. Sometimes it can be that the fuel pump does not pump an
                adequate amount of fuel to the engine, causing the engine to sputter, with the car slowing down and
                speeding up constantly. Similarly, it can be that the car suddenly surges forward when driving at a
                constant speed. It usually means that parts of the pump have worn or that its electrical and elements
                connections let through an irregular current. In other cases, a fuel pump can malfunction completely,
                which means that no fuel is pushed to the engine, as a result the engine will not start or cut out.

                There is really no reason to pre-emptively replace the fuel pump before 100,000 miles. Fuel pumps have
                been known to last for over 200,000 miles in some cases.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Insufficient flow limits cooling and lubrication of the pump. A leading cause of fuel pump failure is
                running the fuel tank low. This is particularly critical on late model vehicles without a fuel pressure
                return system. Running such a vehicle out of fuel once can permanently damage the fuel pump.

                What are the signs of a bad fuel pump relay?
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Usually a bad or failing fuel pump relay will produce a few symptoms that can alert the driver of the
                issues. One of the first symptoms of an issue with the fuel pump relay is an engine that suddenly
                stalls. Engine does not start. No noise from the fuel pump. Can a bad battery cause fuel pump to not
                work? Many driveability and starting problems that are charging, starting or ignition related may be due
                to low battery voltage. Low battery voltage can also affect fuel delivery by causing the fuel pump to
                run slower than normal. This, in turn, causes, low fuel pressure and a lean fuel condition. Can running
                out of fuel damage fuel pump? Running a fuel engine out of fuel doesn't hurt the engine, but it can have
                negative effects on the fuel pump. If you run out of fuel, the fuel pump isn't being cooled anymore and
                you can damage the pump. Fuel pumps are in the fuel tank in most cars these days.

                Maintaining the heat in your car's engine can also possibly be the solution for the need of starting
                your car with bad fuel pump. The main reason why your car starts, even with a bad fuel pump is that once
                the car gets cool, the fuel pump resets itself without the required pressure and heat. What are the
                symptoms of having air in the fuel line? Symptoms of a Bad or Failing Fuel Return Hose Strong fuel
                smell, engine misfires, and decreasing power. One of the first symptoms of an issue with the fuel return
                hose is an excessive fuel smell. Carburettor flooding, engine stalling, and hard starting. Another
                symptom of a potential problem with the fuel return hose is carburettor flooding. Can a fuel pump be
                weak? A weak fuel pump may still pump fuel however, the vehicle may have trouble starting because of the
                lack in pressure. Can a clogged fuel filter cause fuel pump failure? If the fuel filter is clogged, the
                flow of fuel will be reduced or even stopped. The filter should be cleaned or replaced, if needed. A
                clogged fuel filter will cause your vehicle to struggle while starting. Other engine problems due to a
                faulty fuel filter include backfiring, stalling and hesitation. Will fuel pump stop car from starting?
                It is a simple fact of life that if the fuel pump stops working the car will stop moving. It is the fuel
                pump that sees to it that fuel gets from the tank to the engine. While it is possible to run on a
                failing fuel pump for a certain distance it will sooner or later no longer operate.
