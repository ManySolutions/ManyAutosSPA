                The fuel injectors are part of the fuel supply system of the engine (provided it is a petrol engine),
                they usually inject the fuel directly into the cylinders, but in some cars the injectors are situated in
                the inlet manifold. The injectors diffuse the fuel, which then mixes with the air being let into the
                engine by the inlet valves and, in turn, the spark plugs will ignite the mixture to combust.

                When should you consider a fuel injector replacement?
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Over time, the fuel injectors can be affected by dirty fuel which will mean that the injectors can clog
                up in turn the injectors will not be able to diffuse the fuel optimally. In most cases it means that the
                fuel lines or fuel tank have started to corrode. Alternatively, it can be that the fuel filter has
                become ineffective, not filtering out debris as it should. All of this leads to engine misfires and
                therefore an engine that does not run smoothly. Should you experience problems with the fuel supply,
                then it is advisable to have the fuel supply system and the fuel injectors inspected and, if necessary,
                have the fuel injectors replaced. Seeing that the fuel injectors are especially prone to deterioration
                over time they should always be replaced as and when stipulated in the guidelines set out by your car's
                manufacturer.

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Diagnosing a clogged injector is not always easy because it acts
                  the same as a broken spark plug wire or a bad spark plug. One or more cylinders are not firing. Old
                  fuel, carbon and residue inside the fuel cause fuel injectors and or their filter baskets to become
                  clogged.</p>

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                One of the most common symptoms of faulty fuel injectors is an extremely violent or rough engine idle.
                If fuel is not properly provided to the engine cylinder, it will result in a choppy engine, when the car
                is in idle. Fuel injector can crack or break, which will cause a gas leak.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                The fuel injectors can become clogged with dirt and oil, which means the fuel isn't getting to the
                engine properly. If it's faulty, you will probably be getting bad fuel mileage, or you'll notice it's
                hard for the car to pick up speed. A faulty sensor will also make the Check Engine light turn on.

                A faulty fuel injector can cause the vehicle to experience misfires, a loss in power and acceleration, a
                reduction in fuel efficiency, and in severe cases can cause stalling or prevent the engine from running
                at all.
