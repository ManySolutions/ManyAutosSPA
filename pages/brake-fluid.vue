                cars, vans, motorcycles and even some bicycles with hydraulic brakes. Hydraulic fluid works by
                transferring force into pressure so that braking force is taken to the max. It needs to be replaced
                every two years as it can slowly become corrosive. Brake fluid can also be used as clutch fluid, which
                you'll need if your car is manual. This helps to keep your clutch moving as it should, ensuring your
                journey is as smooth as possible. Brake cleaner can improve the performance of your braking system as it
                removes dust, dirt and grime from integral braking parts. We've got a huge selection of brake fluid,
                including DOT 5.1 and DOT 4 brake fluid, and brands such as Mobil and Comma oil. Suitable for a variety
                of different cars, you can rest assured that we'll have something suitable for you for years as it can
                slowly become corrosive. Brake fluid can also be used as clutch fluid, which you'll need if your car is
                manual. This helps to keep your clutch moving as it should, ensuring your journey is as smooth as
                possible. A vital part of car maintenance is to change your brake fluid to ensure safety of brake
                components. Most manufacturers recommend that you change your brake fluid every 24 months or 24,000
                miles, whichever is sooner. Our fully qualified technicians will drain the old fluid and then refill
                with new brake fluid to the correct specification. We will also safely dispose of the old fluid in an
                environmentally friendly way.</p>

                Brake fluid is a special composite liquid which produces the power which moves the various parts of your
                vehicles brake system. Specially formulated to work at high temperatures and under high pressure, it's a
                substance which can't be compressed. When you press your brake pedal, this sends it through the pipes
                which are linked to the brake cylinders on each corner of your vehicle. This, in turn, applies pressure
                to the inner rims of your wheels, which then slows or stops the vehicle. In simplified terms, this is
                how the brake fluid works in your braking system. You press the brake pedal. The pedal presses down a
                piston inside the brake caliper. The compression causes pressure to build up within the brake lines and
                sets the brake fluid in motion. The brake fluid then creates pressure which acts on the brake rotors,
                causing them to push down on the brake pads, bringing them into contact with the wheels, slowing them
                down and eventually stopping them completely. Believe it or not, there are several types of brake fluid
                on the market, and the right one for your car/vehicle's system depends on the type of system it is. For
                example, anti-lock brake systems use glycol-based brake fluid, while non-ABS one's work with
                silicon-based liquids.

                How, And How Often, Do I Change My Car's Brake Fluid?

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Because it is regularly called upon to work at high temperatures, your brake fluid will lose its
                effectiveness over time. Most car-makers suggest it is done as part of a major service, which is usually
                carried out every two years. For example, Volkswagen recommends this, but also says that the first brake
                fluid change is not needed until the car is three years old. Franchised main dealers usually drain and
                flush brake fluid using a special machine. But you can do this job yourself, if you have a few bits of
                specialist equipment and an hour or so on your hands. Firstly though, remember that brake fluid can be
                corrosive, so you should take care not to get it on your skin. It's also a good idea to wear a pair of
                disposable gloves while you're doing the job. You can top up your brake fluid without draining your
                system, and you can buy the stuff from lots of shops which sell car parts. But brake fluid deteriorates
                rapidly once it meets the air, because water vapour can cause rust in the system, but it also lowers
                your brake fluids boiling point. In cold weather, this can lead to ice crystals forming in it, which
                will eventually turn to water, and will reduce the effectiveness of your brakes. If your car is fitted
                with ABS, contaminated fluid can damage and even destroy important working parts of such systems. To
                change your brake fluid, follow this sequence: Remove the old, dirty fluid from the master cylinder
                reservoir. You can do this using a turkey baster, If you can get access to it, wipe out the reservoir
                with a lint-free cloth as you slowly empty it. The system should then be flushed, but this is a job for
                two people, as you will need someone to loosen the bolts securing the bleeder valves. As these usually
                go many months without being loosened, they have a habit of becoming jammed. So, they need to be gently
                manipulated - with the help of a few squirts of lubricating oil to ease them loose if necessary. If you
                can apply this a couple of days beforehand to give it the chance to penetrate every little crevice, so
                much the better. Surface rust may also have accumulated on them, so a few gentle taps with a hammer may
                be called for to disperse this. Loosen the bolts but leave them attached and closed. Take a piece of
                clear plastic tubing (for example the type commonly used in an aquarium, which has the extra benefit of
                being cheap). Push one end of the tube over the brake bleeder bolt at the right rear of the car. Place
                the other end of the tube in a small, clear bottle with an inch or two of clean brake fluid in it - this
                will prevent air being sucked back into the brake cylinder or caliper. Put a small (about 10cm x 2.5cm
                should do it) piece of wood or similar material under the pedal to prevent the pedal from traveling too
                far when line pressure is released. Top up the master cylinder reservoir with fresh fluid, up to the
                fill line which should be marked on the outside of the pipe, and put the cover back on the reservoir,
                then immediately replace the cap to prevent fluid from squirting out when you next press the brake
                pedal. Fluid will squirt out of an open reservoir every time the pedal is released. As you refill the
                reservoir, you should take care not to let it get more than half empty. Enlist a helper to get into the
                car and press the brake pedal on your cue. When you say so, they should press the pedal with the same
                amount of force as if they were trying to stop the car from rolling forward. Next, the helper, while
                keeping their foot on the pedal with the same amount of pressure, gives a cue. You have to then warn
                them that the pedal is about to sink further down, but they should keep their foot on the pedal, again
                keeping the pressure constant, while you tighten the bleeder bolt a quarter of a turn. This will release
                a trickle of old, contaminated fluid, and, as this stops and is replaced by clean fluid, you should
                close the bleed bolt.
