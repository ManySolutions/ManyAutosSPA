              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">The camshaft controls the intake and exhaust valves of an internal combustion engine, regulating the four strokes (Intake, Compression, Power, and Exhaust) of the ignition process. The camshaft is sequenced to rotate at half the speed of the crankshaft, and all camshafts must be properly "timed" or severe engine damage could occur. Installing camshafts is advanced engine work, but you can learn to approach the job as safely as possible for your make and model, and some general tips on getting the job done correctly.</p>

                Whether the camshaft is in a push rod engine or an overhead cam engine, it controls the opening and closing of the valves. This, in turn, controls the flow of air and fuel into and out of the engine which determines engine performance, fuel economy and emissions.

               Vehicle does not drive like it used to. If your vehicle idles roughly, stalls frequently, has a drop-in engine power, stumbles frequently, has reduced gas mileage, or accelerates slowly, these are all signs your camshaft position sensor could be failing. Check Engine Light comes on. Vehicle will not start.

               The key parts of any camshaft are the lobes. As the camshaft spins, the lobes open and close the intake and exhaust valves in time with the motion of the piston. It turns out that there is a direct relationship between the shape of the cam lobes and the way the engine performs in different speed ranges.

                  <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Double overhead cams control the opening and closing of a cylinder's valves. Valve timing gears on a four-cylinder engine the small gear is on the crankshaft, the larger gear is on the camshaft. The gear ratio causes the camshaft to run at half the RPM of the crankshaft. of car engines? Generally, engines with dual overhead camshafts (DOHC) are higher performance engines, they produce more power, and can run at higher speeds. The camshaft uses rotating lobes, called cams, that push against the valves to open them. The valve train is a collection of synchronised components responsible for optimising the timing and performance of the engine. Made up of numerous valves, rocker arms, pushrods, lifters and at least one camshaft, the valve train simultaneously regulates fuel intake, compression, ignition and waste expulsion by opening and closing a series of valves. Synchronised to the crankshaft by a chain, belt or gear array, the processes and timings overseen by the valve train speeds up or slows down accordingly in order to maximise performance and efficiency. Over time, the movements and consistency of the valve train can begin to slip as parts begin to wear away. Mistimed valve openings early, late, too short or long, can immediately affect a vehicleâ€™s performance and potentially cause serious engine damage. Different engine configurations will use different valve trains.</p>

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
               A broken camshaft is usually caused by a connecting rod or other rotating part coming loose and striking it. Sometimes the cam will break after a short time of use because of a crack or fracture in the cam due to rough handling during shipping or improper handling prior to installation.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                As the camshaft position sensor weakens, the signal it transmits to the vehicle's ECM also weakens. Eventually, the signal will weaken so much the signal will switch off, and so will the engine. This can happen while the vehicle is parked, or while you are driving. The latter can be a dangerous situation.

               Symptoms of a Bad Camshaft Position Sensor. 1 On some vehicles, a failing camshaft may lock the transmission in a single gear until you turn off and restart the engine. 2 If the sensor begins to fail while your car is moving, you may feel the car jerking while losing power. 3 You may experience a noticeable loss of engine power.

              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Advancing or retarding a camshaft's timing from its original zero position causes the valve events to happen either earlier or later in the engine's cycle. On the other hand, if the camshaft timing is retarded, the intake valve will close later usually sometime during the compression stroke.
