        Choosing the perfect garage for your vehicle is a big headache. You do your research and look through multiple
        things before making a choice. What in your opinion is the most efficient way to choose a garage for regular
        maintenance? Do you like to look at the online reviews or ask for your friends and family’s advice? It’s not
        ideal to just pull up to some car repairing centre and hope that they would do the required work properly. Well,
        now you don’t have to endure this torture of selecting the perfect garage, because we have taken that
        responsibility upon ourselves. You just have to register on our site and book the desired service for your car,

        When should you get your car serviced?
      </h2>
      <p>
        It is okay and normal if you forget when an MOT is due or when you should take your car to undergo a full
        service. For the MOT, you can take advantage from our “MOT check history service” and learn everything you need
        to know. Not only the date of the upcoming MOT but also all the details about the previous MOT test.
        As far as the service is concerned, we recommend you to check and follow the owner’s manual. It is supposed to
        contain every information about the servicing and the replacements of car parts. It is compulsory that you save
        the records of off the services that your car go through. This information will come handy when you forget the
        date of the last service or when you wish to sell your car. It will insight of your car maintenance to the next
        buyer. The age, make, mileage and the average usage of the vehicle in a day plays an important role in the
        servicing. Generally, a car is recommended to undergo interim service every 6000 miles (6-months) and a full
        service every 12,000 miles (12-months).
