              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">The handbrake cables link the handbrake lever to the parking brakes
                to stop the car from rolling downhill. Frayed or broken handbrake cables are dangerous and must be
                replaced. Different models of car use different handbrake systems, but by far the most common is a
                mechanical system of lever, rods and cables operated manually by the driver. A number of possible cable
                configurations can be used depending on what type of car you have (e.g. front- or rear-wheel drive), but
                a typical set-up consists of a primary cable attached to a yoke, and a secondary cable that wraps around
                this yolk and runs to each rear wheel. Pulling on the handbrake causes the primary cable to draw up the
                yolk, causing tension in the secondary cable; this instigates the braking action. If you find you are
                having to pull your handbrake very hard to keep your car stable on a hill, chances are your handbrake
                linkage system has worn over time and the cables themselves have slackened. Eventually the linkage will
                need replacing or else the cables might one day suddenly snap â€“ rendering your handbrake both useless
                and illegal.</p>

                We all remember learning our Handbrake Cables when driving Accelerator, brake, clutch. But did you know
                that when you press down on any of the pedals, the force is transferred through a cable to the relevant
                parts inside your car. If these cables snap or even fail, this could cause real problems when you're
                driving.

                In cars, the parking brake, also called hand brake, emergency brake, or e-brake, is a latching brake
                usually used to keep the vehicle stationary. It is sometimes also used to prevent a vehicle from rolling
                when the operator needs both feet to operate the clutch and throttle pedals. Automobile hand brakes
                usually consist of a cable directly connected to the brake mechanism on one end and to a lever or foot
                pedal at the driver's position. The mechanism is often a hand-operated lever (hence the hand brake
                name), on the floor on either side of the driver, or a pull handle located below and near the steering
                wheel column, or a (foot-operated) pedal located far apart from the other pedals. Source.

                The handbrake on most cars is a mechanical linkage of rods and cables, operated by a lever on the car's
                floor or dash. Over a period of time, the linkage wears - the cables become slack, or the pivot points
                and linkage pins become badly grooved, allowing slack to build up. You can compensate for wear until the
                handbrake adjuster won't take up any slacker, then you need to fit new parts.

              <v-expansion-panel-content class="card-header-body">
                Most cars use one of several lay- outs, depending on whether they are front- or rear-wheel drive, and
                whether the handbrake operates on the front or rear wheels. This, in turn, determines how you replace
                the cable. These Mechanics sheets look at one of the most common and simple systems in use - it is found
                on many cars, including Fords and Vauxhalls. This system has the handbrake pulling on a short primary
                rod or cable that is attached to a U-shaped guide known as an equalizer yoke. Another cable (the
                secondary cable) loops around this yoke and runs to each rear wheel. At each brake backplate the
                secondary cable is attached to a lever that operates the shoes inside the drum. When the handbrake is
                pulled on, the primary rod or cable pulls on the yoke and that tensions the secondary cable. In
                addition, the secondary cable may also be one of two types. One design has the cable exposed along its
                full length, running in metal guides welded to the underside of the car. The other design uses an
                enclosed Bowden cable where the handbrake cable runs for part of its length within an outer sheath.

              <v-expansion-panel-content class="card-header-body">
                If your car has an exposed handbrake cable that is in good condition but has simply stretched too far
                for the adjuster to compensate, you can buy an extra, proprietary, cable adjuster to take out some of
                the slack. The adjuster is a simple clamp that fits to the cable itself. First slacken off the existing
                handbrake adjuster a little. Then, with the clamp in place, tighten the bolt on the side to take up the
                slack. Any further adjustments can be made with the proper cable adjuster. The only point to watch is
                that the extra adjuster must not foul on any other components under the car not always an easy job.

                To find out where the wear lies, support the rear of the car on axle stands, chock the front wheels and
                release the handbrake. Get under the car and watch the linkage while a helper works the handbrake lever
                on and off. Watch for any lost motion in the joints indicating that the clevis pin is badly worn. If
                there is no slack in any of the joints, yet the handbrake is on maximum adjustment, then the cable may
                have stretched. You can sometimes fit an extra cable adjuster to take out some of the slack and give the
                cable a new lease of life (see side line overleaf) but, if not, then you must buy and fit a new cable.

                The metal hand brake cable links the handbrake lever you pull if you want to park with the hand brake

                brake drums) locking the discs into place and preventing the car's wheels from moving.

                  predominantly hilly area. Should the hand brake fail it is therefore important to have it repaired as
