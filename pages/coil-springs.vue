              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Coil springs absorb vibrations and bumps on the road, delivering a
                smoother ride for you and the passengers. If you need coil spring replacements, look no further than
                Many Autos. An integral part of a car's suspension, coil springs have been designed to absorb shock. As
                you travel, your vehicle will come across plenty of bumps in the road - and it's a coil spring's job to
                make sure you hardly feel the effects. Over time, coil springs can lose their elasticity. This happens
                with general wear and tear, and for the most comfortable ride possible it's best to replace them. Every
                model of car will be different, so it's best to consult your owner's manual or chat with an expert at
                Many Autos.</p>

                What does a Coil Spring do?
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                A coil spring is a helical spring that compresses and expands as you drive over a road surface, it
                absorbs the bumps in the road and counters excessive bouncing that might occur after the initial shock
                absorption. In other words, the coil spring smooths out the road's irregularities. The coil spring
                encapsulates, in many cases, the shock absorber and essentially forms a single unit that is mounted
                between the upper and lower wishbone. Sometimes a coil / shock absorber unit can also be part of a
                suspension strut, as in a MacPherson suspension system.

                When should you consider a Coil Spring replacement?
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Over time, a coil spring can wear. The protective plastic coating fitted to most springs can flake due
                to continuous compression and expansion of the spring, often corroding the spring and leading to an
                increasingly brittle metal spring. The small cracks that appear can lead to bigger cracks and eventually
                the spring can snap. It is therefore important that the condition of the coil springs is checked
                regularly, to prevent further, more expensive, damage to the car. A broken coil spring will render the
                car unsafe to drive. In some cases, the car will lean to one side upsetting the balance of the
                suspension. Moreover, the spring might puncture the tyre or the car's body can collapse onto the wheel
                leading to a potentially dangerous driving situation. Problems with the coil springs that are not
                addressed timely and professionally can thus lead to a variety of other, more expensive, issues. Should
                you experience problems with a coil spring then it is advisable to have the system inspected and, if
                necessary, have the coil spring replaced. To ensure a well-balanced suspension system the coil springs
                are, depending on which spring has failed, replaced in front pairs or rear pairs. Always service the
                coil spring as and when stipulated in the guidelines set out by your car's manufacturer.

                shocks into an assembly with springs and other suspension parts to last at least four or five years.

                Car Coil springs, also called suspensions springs, are made with wide gap coils that compress to absorb
                impact when tyres roll over rough terrain. In addition to improving ride quality by reducing bounce,
                coil springs and struts are also a critical component that gives the car its height and keeps it off the
                ground.

                It's recommended to replace coil springs in pairs, and to replace the shocks at the same time. Replacing
                coil springs can be extremely dangerous because of the incredible amount of energy stored by a
                compressed coil spring. As such, youâ€™ll need a coil spring compressor.
