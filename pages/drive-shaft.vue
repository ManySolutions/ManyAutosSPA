                Function of drive shaft
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">The function of the drive shaft is to transfer the engine torque from a gearbox or differential to the
                wheels. It must also compensate for all variations in angle or length resulting from manoeuvring and
                deflection for perfect synchronisation between joints.
                Drive shafts for cars with front wheel drive consist of the outboard fixed joint, the inboard constant
                velocity joint and the connecting shaft. They also include elements such as the anti-lock system ring
                and the torsion damper. The basic design of the outboard fixed ball joint, the constant velocity joint,
                dates from the 1930s.</p>
                In most cases the inboard CVJ takes the form of a slip joint to allow the drive shaft to follow the
                movements of the wheel suspension. At the front axle (leading axle) the outboard joint must transfer the
                torque effectively through a large angle (up to 52 degrees). At the rear axle the angles of the outboard
                joints are considerably smaller.
                Constant velocity drive shafts are exposed to maximum stress all the time that the vehicle is in
                operation. Alongside the extremely significant displacement angles and translational movement, the
                joints and bellows must be able to withstand temperatures of between minus 40 and plus 120 °C as well as
                speeds of up to 2800 rpm. In order to transmit the required torque in all engine speed and velocity
                ranges with reliable constancy (ideally throughout the entire service life of the vehicle), all
                components must be maintenance-free.

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Drive shafts and constant velocity joints are components of modern
                  cars, which demand maximum safety.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Most problems with the drive shaft manifest themselves in the form
                  of knocking noises when driving round tight corners, accelerating, or when the suspension is being
                  compressed and extended. To avoid putting the safety of the vehicle at risk, make an appointment with
                  Many Autos if any of these symptoms occur. Specialists can be relied upon to detect damage to the
                  drive shaft and provide the necessary assistance in good time.</p>

                Wear over time is one of the most frequent causes of damage to outboard and inboard joints. Damage can
                also be caused by faulty sleeves, by use of low-quality grease and in many cases by not following the
                correct procedures for installation and removal.

                To maximise their service lives, drive shafts must be inspected regularly at a specialist garage. Such
                inspections are carried out as part of the regular service checks prescribed by vehicle manufacturers.
                Another good time to check the condition of drive shafts is when switching from summer to winter tyres
                or vice versa.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                The specialist checks that the drive shaft is seated firmly and is clean and that the sleeves are in
                good order. Damaged sleeves must be replaced immediately to prevent damage to the joint caused by dirt
                penetration or grease escaping. If sleeves are loose or worn, there is a risk that dirt or moisture will
                already have penetrated into the joint. If in doubt, both the damaged sleeve and the entire joint should
                be replaced for safety reasons.

                Most joint sleeves on newer vehicles are made from TPE. As a rule: A TPE sleeve must not be replaced
                with a rubber sleeve. The relevant specification must also be complied with when topping up with grease.
                High-performance greases can withstand temperatures up to 160 °C for short periods; standard joint
                lubricants are designed to withstand only 110 °C for short periods. Use of a standard grease in a
                high-performance application can cause gas evolution from the grease and ultimately lead to the total
                failure of the joint.

                  professionally reconditioned drive shafts are available on the market. When used drive shafts (most of
                  which will have been damaged) are reconditioned, the old parts are taken back from vehicle garages for
                  professional recycling in special production plants in accordance with the standards set for original
                  equipment.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">As part of this process, all usable steel parts are reused. The old
                  shafts are inspected, taken apart, cleaned, remained and then put back together for the car repairs
                  market. Other materials resulting from the reconditioning process (old grease, metal chips or worn
                  steel parts, for example) are disposed of in the correct and proper way in accordance with applicable
                  environmental guidelines. Recycling significantly reduces the consumption of both raw materials and
                  energy and makes a significant contribution to active protection of the environment.</p>
