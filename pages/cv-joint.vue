                CV Joints wear over time. If you need to replace one or both of your CV joints, the complete CV joint kits listed below will see you right, offering you everything you need to solve the issue at hand The name ‘CV joint’ refers to constant velocity. Each CV joint rotates at a constant speed and in doing so, it allows your car’s gearbox to transmit power at a variable angle. This reduces friction and play, which in turn increases your car’s efficiency. Exposure to dirt and moisture is the main cause of CV joint failure. Such exposure will cause joints to corrode, and they become especially vulnerable when the CV boot tears or cracks. The failure of the joint will cause a clunking sound when you turn your wheel, and may also be evident when you accelerate or slow down. our premium-quality CV joint kits come complete with stainless bands, a CV boot, circlip, spindle nut, grease, and of course the joint itself.

                When turning the wheel sharp, if the front end makes a clicking or banging noise when the vehicle moves you almost certainly have bad cv joints.

                A drive shaft, driveshaft, driving shaft, tailshaft, propeller shaft, or Cardan shaft is a mechanical component for transmitting torque and rotation, usually used to connect other components of a drive train that cannot be connected directly because of distance or the need to allow for relative movement between them.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Short for ‘propeller shaft’, the propshaft is a rotating metal tube used in a rear-wheel-drive car to transmit torque and rotation to the rear axle (equivalent to the driveshaft in a front-wheel-drive car). It runs from the gearbox to the differential along almost the entire underside of your vehicle and is constructed as either one or two interconnecting pieces. It needs to remain securely attached whilst accommodating variable movement during the inevitable twisting and vibrating of normal driving.
