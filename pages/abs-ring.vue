              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">ABS rings are an essential part in all modern braking systems, and
                faulty rings will result in an instant MOT failure. ABS rings fit on each wheel, working with sensors to
                send wheel-speed data to the Anti-lock Braking System controller. Using this data, the ABS controller
                stops the wheels from locking up by ensuring each one stays in sync. It does this by applying hydraulic
                pressure at just the right time. A faulty ABS ring will cause a warning signal to light up on your
                dashboard. When this happens you must replace the faulty ring immediately. Without vital data from the
                ABS rings and their sensors, the controller won’t do its job properly and your car will become unsafe to
                drive.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">ABS Ring is A anti-lock braking system consists of a controller, a
                  speed sensor, valves, and the ABS Speed sensor ring. The system maintains the traction of tires on
                  road and the performance of the brake against high speed is significantly improved. ABS speed sensor
                  ring is the main component of the entire system, as it carefully monitors the speed of wheels and
                  transmits important signals which can alert the system electronically. These rings come in various
                  designs, depending on the type of your vehicle, the location of the sensor on your vehicle and its
                  design. Certain designs are installed in the front and rare region of the driver area while others are
                  installed in the front and rear parts of the passenger regions. The ring installation greatly varies
                  with the ABS system design. The ring may be concealed or open, but to make sure that the sensor works
                  accurately and properly, we must ensure that it is maintained and kept clean. When the brake is
                  heavily pushed, the extra force that is put can lock the wheels with help of brake discs which can
                  cause the vehicle to skid along the road. This is very dangerous, which is mitigated by the ABS ring
                  function. with the help of the ring, the difference is sensed by the ABS sensor and signal is
                  generated to the controller. In case the ABS ring is failed, the ABS controlled will receive improper
                  readings.</p>

                  (ABS) light to come on. Some of those things are serious, but oftentimes it just means you need to
                  give a little attention to your car ABS. Since the location of the ABS ring is mainly exposed to the
                  undercarriage of your car, they are likely to catch contaminants as your car ages on the miles. The
                  most common contaminants could be water, dirt, debris, etc. Also, usually your rear ABS rings are not
                  made up of exceptional materials so they are likely to get even more damage over time compared to the
                  front rings.</p>

                  that the ABS Light will come on the dashboard of your car. The ABS Light might as well be called the
                  Check Engine Light in some cars that don’t have a separate indicator light for the ABS framework. At
                  the point when the light is illuminated this is typically the principal sign that will tell you that
                  there might be an issue with your car’s ABS system you have perhaps developed an issue with one of the
                  system’s sensors or ring. The issue could be small such as just a dirty ABS sensor, but it could be
                  serious if it’s because of a faulty sensor or ABS ring.</p>

                  rapidly banging noise unnecessarily at low speeds just like it does while driving on ice. Which means
                  your ABS system is engaging unnecessarily at a lower speed. This is a clear indication of a faulty ABS
                  ring. The faulty ABS ring is not considered to be a fault by the system, which is why the ABS warning
                  light does not illuminate at first but it lights up only when the system has completely shut down. On
                  different occasions, it may even go on and off several times. A flawed ABS ring delivers an incorrect
                  signal, which tricks the cars electrical control unit to start the Anti-lock Braking System just
                  before the vehicle comes to a stop, or even switch off totally which decreases your vehicle control
                  and increases the ceasing distance. Usually, in numerous circumstances, you only need to change the
                  ABS rings, complete replacement of the drive shaft and/or joints is not required. </p>

                  this is an indicator of faulty ABS system. This could be due to over corroded ABS rings or a cracked
