              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Over time, the force applied to wheel cylinders causes them to leak
                or wear away, which can reduce the reliability and response time of your brakes. As an integral part of
                the drum brake system, wheel cylinders are most commonly situated directly above each wheel,
                perpendicular to the direction the wheel travels. Consisting of a small cylinder with a piston on each
                end, wheel cylinders are at opposite end of the brake line to the brake pedal, so when the pedal is
                pressed the brake fluid is forced into the cylinders which pushes the pistons out. In turn, the pistons
                push the brake shoes into contact with the wheel drums, slowing the vehicle through the friction this
                generates. Older wheel cylinders can eventually split and crack under pressure, while the pistons can be
                worn down, reducing the force with which the brakes can be applied. Cracks can also result in brake
                fluid leaks which, as well as being potentially corrosive, can lead to serious hydraulic failure if left
                unchecked. While most wheel cylinders incorporate two pistons, some designs use two separate,
                single-piston cylinders, so it’s a good idea to check what you need before ordering your replacements.

                If you've got a vehicle with a drum braking system, wheel cylinders will form a pretty important part of
                what makes your car stop when you hit the brakes. The wheel cylinder exerts force onto the brake shoes,
                pushing them into the drum and creating the friction to stop your car. When vehicles get older, brake
                wheel cylinders tend to have a habit of starting to leak, but the good news is they're usually pretty
                cheap and easy to replace.

                A wheel cylinder is a component of a hydraulic drum brake. The wheel cylinder must force apart the brake
                shoes and press them against the brake drum. This generates friction and the wheel is decelerated. This
                happens every time the driver presses on the brake pedal. Pressing on the brake pedal generates a
                hydraulic pressure in the master brake cylinder which is transmitted to the wheel cylinder in the brake
                fluid via the brake lines. In the wheel cylinder, the hydraulic pressure acts on the pistons, which then
                exert mechanical pressure on the brake shoes.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                The wheel cylinder is a safety-relevant vehicle part. It should be checked regularly as part of regular
                service and maintenance to ensure that it is perfect working order. When the brake shoes or the brake
                drums are replaced, it is advisable to replace the wheel cylinder at the same time. This will avoid
                follow-up repairs having to be made soon after. A damaged wheel cylinder will impair braking performance
                and lead to loss of brake fluid. In the worst-case scenario, it can cause the total failure of the drum
                brake or even a complete brake circuit. Therefore, should a driver notice a drop-in braking effect, the
                vehicle should be taken to a specialist garage immediately. Only trained specialists are permitted to
                install wheel brake cylinders.

                Wheel cylinders do not need special maintenance in order for the vehicle to maintain its value. It is
                just important to observe prescribed service and maintenance intervals, in particular those for
                replacing brake fluid. As part of regular service and maintenance, the garage will check the drum brake
                for wear and effectiveness. If a wheel cylinder or other parts of the drum brake have to be replaced,
                only high-quality production components should be used. They must also be installed correctly. These two
                considerations are vital for optimum brake performance and also help the vehicle retain its value.
