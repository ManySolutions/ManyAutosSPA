              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">A crucial part of a car’s steering system, having a functional and
                reliable centre drag link will help keep you safe when you’re on the road. Connected to both the Pitman
                and idler arms at either end, the centre drag link (also known as the centre link) is joined to the
                inner tie rods. The job of centre drag links is to manoeuvre inner tie rod ends such that a vehicle’s
                wheels turn properly when the steering wheel is moved. If your steering feels like it has a mind of its
                own, is wandering or feeling generally wrong, there’s a chance that your centre drag link may need
                replacing. If it fails, your steering could fail a very dangerous situation if it occurs when you’re on
                the go.</p>

                An alternate steering mechanism is a rack and pinion, a three-bar linkage that eliminates the drag link
                by directly moving a centre link. The drag link connects the pitman arm to the steering arm, or in some
                applications it connects to the tie rod assembly.

                The drag link connects the pitman arm to the steering arm, or in some applications it connects to the
                tie rod assembly. Unlike a centre link, the drag link does not connect to an idler arm and has no inner
                tie rod ends attached to it. Drag links can be a solid one-piece design or an adjustable design.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                A drag link is a suspension linkage component that is found in vehicles equipped with steering gear type
                steering systems. Drag links are most commonly found on larger vehicles and vans and serve as the
                component that links the vehicle's steering gear box to the tie rod ends.

                The term is commonly used in automotive technology for the link in steering linkage that converts
                rotation of a pitman arm to a steering arm and eventually to tie rod links which pivot the wheels to be
                steered. On these applications the drag link connects to the steering arm located at the wheel.

                The pitman arm attaches to the steering gear output shaft which is also commonly called the pitman
                shaft. The pitman arm attaches to the centre link and is moved by turning the steering wheel. The centre
                link transfers the movement from the pitman arm and pitman shaft to the idler arm on the passenger side.

                The steering rack is composed of a rack enclosed with a steering pinion. It is connected to the steering
                wheel through the set of shafts and U-joints. A power steering rack utilizes an engine-driven pump to
                supply high-pressure hydraulic fluid to the steering rack when the wheel is turned.

                A rack and pinion gear set is enclosed in a metal tube, with each end of the rack protruding from the

                steering shaft. When you turn the steering wheel, the gear spins, moving the rack.
