      <p>
        Like other machines and devices, the car also needs maintenance regularly so it can be used easily, without any
        difficulty. If you do not take regular maintenance services for your car, then it would become out of order on
        the way and you have to find a professional car maintenance service provider near you, which is difficult to
        find.
      </p>
      <h2>Safety of the driver</h2>
      <p class="margin-bottom-10 text-justify text-teal">
       The safety of the driver depends upon the maintenance of the car. For saving a few pounds, if you do not take
       maintenance services and the driver faces any kind of accident then it would cost you a lot rather than
       maintenance cost. Therefore, you should consider high profile and best car services provider Company that
       provides you repairing and maintenance services anywhere in the city. You can benefit from the offers provided by
       the garages like a <NuxtLink to="/vehicle-engine-diagnostic-services">free car diagnostic</NuxtLink> test and get the required repairs.
      </p>
      <h2>Prevents life-threatening accidents</h2>
      <p class="margin-bottom-10 text-justify text-teal">
        The regular service of the car maintains all the parts of it and prevents any accident. Further, due to the
        regular check-up of the car, the company would come to know the condition of different parts of the cars and
        timely change it so that you do not have to face any big accident. Commonly, thousands of people around the
        world died in car accidents due to lack of <NuxtLink to="/car-service">car maintenance</NuxtLink>. Therefore, do not
        compromise with the car condition just for saving a few pounds, love your life, and spend money by hiring a
        professional company.
      </p>
      <h2>What things to check with the car at the time of service</h2>
      <h3>Check the fluids of the car</h3>
      <p class="margin-bottom-10 text-justify text-teal">
        The check-up of the car is essential and provides many advantages to the driver. At the time of checkup and
        services, change the oil of the car after every 3000 miles running, check brake fluid, power steering fluid, and
        transmission fluid and further you should consider all fluids, which are leaking and need repairs on the spot.
      </p>
       <h3>Inspect the condition of the tyres</h3>
      <p class="margin-bottom-10 text-justify text-teal">
        It is essential to check tyre condition after running the car around 7000 miles. The car tyres lose grip from
        the road when you do ruff car use continuously. Therefore, you should prefer to change tyres when you see the
        car is sleeping on the road when you put a foot on the brick.
      </p>
      <p class="margin-bottom-10 text-justify text-teal">
        Thousands of accidents happen on the road due to the low grip of tyres. Most of the insurance companies claim
        that these accidents have happened due to the lack of <NuxtLink to="/brake-pads">vehicle maintenance and repair</NuxtLink>, and they will not bear the
        cost of it because the owner did not follow the rules of insurance. So it is important to take your car for a
        check-up every month to professional service providers.
