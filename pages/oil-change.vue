                The grade and type of oil you use can also impact your car's economy and emissions, so it is essential
                that you use the correct grade of oil. Unlike blood, engine oils don't self-cleanse and after a short
                amount of time will start to degrade and become progressively dirtier and less efficient.

                the engine runs out of oil, it will start to grind, and then seize up, stalling the vehicle.

                Car engines have many moving parts. As these parts move and rub against each other, the force of
                friction creates heat. Oil lubricates the engine and absorbs heat, allowing the internal parts to work
                together effectively without overheating.

                    draining old engine oil and replacing it with fresh, clean oil, offers a myriad of benefits. Oil
                    changes help to keep car engines clean and running smoothly</p>
