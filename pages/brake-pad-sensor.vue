              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">The brake pad sensor is a single-use, but nevertheless essential
                piece of equipment. It performs the job of alerting you when your brake pads are wearing thin, which in
                turn triggers a warning light to indicate that it’s time to replace the brakes. In constant use or when
                placed under high levels of friction, a car's brake pad will inevitably wear down. When the pad has worn
                to a pre-programmed point, the brake pad sensor makes contact with the metal of the brake disc and
                completes an electrical circuit; this action sends a signal to the dashboard in the form of a warning
                light. Once a brake pad sensor has completed a circuit through contact with the rotor, it cannot be
                reused. Every time you change your brake pads you also need to install a new brake pad sensor. It’s
                recommended that you replace the brake pad sensor even if it has not made contact. The brake pad sensor
                is a real advance in automotive safety and your car will not pass its MOT if it has a faulty sensor.</p>

                Brake Pad Wear Sensors. On most German imports, there are brake pad wear sensors. These are more than
                just wires that break when the last 3 mm to 5 mm of pad material make contact with the disc. These
                sensors can warn the driver and technician of the state of the brake pads long before it becomes a
                safety problem.

                The most common type of service required for brakes is changing the pads. Disc brake pads usually have a
                piece of metal on them called a wear indicator. When enough of the friction material is worn away, the
                wear indicator will contact the disc and make a squealing sound. This means it is time for new brake
                pads.

                  point, the wire becomes frayed and/or cut, breaking the circuit which your ECU (engine computer) will
                  detect.</p>

                The Brake Pad Wear sensor, or brake wear indicator, is an added safety feature on many vehicles used to
                warn a vehicle's driver if their brake pad's life becomes too low. The Brake Pad Wear sensor is mounted
                on the brake pad and routed through the callipers in any combination of the four wheels.

                A Brake wear indicator is used to warn the user and/or owner of a vehicle that the brake pad is in need
                of replacement. However, brake wear indicators are also useful for brake pads in industrial
                applications, including wind turbines and cranes.

                The second most common reason for causing a brake light on your dash is if your brake fluid is low.
                There is a sensor that is inside the brake master cylinder that can tell when the fluid gets low. This
                sensor will illuminate the brake warning light to let the driver know that the brake system needs
                attention asap.

                Some vehicles use an electronic sensor to warn you, the driver, when your brake pads are starting to get
                too worn down from the rigors of driving. This is called the brake pad wear sensor, also known as the
                brake pad wear indicator. The most common type of electronic wear sensors is mounted into the brake pad
                itself. On some applications the wear sensor is embedded into the pad and not removable; therefore, they
                are only available with the brake pad. When the brake pad wears down to its discard thickness due to
                contacting the disc while braking over the course of time, the sensor will make contact to the disc,
                thus grounding the sensor. This will cause a brake warning light to illuminate on your dash or
                instrument cluster, indicating that the brake pad friction material is almost gone and that replacement
                brake pads are needed. This light usually looks like a circle, sometimes with an exclamation mark inside
                of it. Brake pad wear indicators are more prevalent on European models. They are usually found on the
                front brakes, but sometimes on the rear brakes as well. So, how many sensors a vehicle will have, and
                their location in terms of what wheels they can be found on will vary.

                In most car repair shops, brake jobs are part of the daily bread-and-butter, straight forward repairs
                that involve parts replacement with little or no diagnosis. Occasionally, however, a job of this sort
                can throw you an unexpected curve. One such kink in the otherwise straight path of a brake job involves
                the car that comes in with the brake pad warning light on and, upon inspection, needs pad replacement at
                one or both ends. After replacement and service of the disc (if necessary) has been completed and the
                car is test driven, the pad warning is still glowing brightly in the instrument cluster. The wear
                sensors were not replaced because they looked fine no broken wires, no contact with the brake disc.
