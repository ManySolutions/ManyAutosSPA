              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">While vacuum pumps are essential to the workings of diesel and hybrid
                engines, they can also boost performance in petrol engines. Installing the right vacuum pump with a
                product from our range can significantly improve your cars response and efficiency. Vacuum pumps draw
                out the gas molecules from a sealed chamber to create a vacuum. The pressure of the vacuum is then used
                to power a wide variety of systems and devices depending on the make and model of your vehicle. In
                diesel and hybrid engines, the vacuum pump is solely responsible for supplying a vital vacuum to the
                brake servo a feature that isn't needed in petrol engines. Despite this, vacuum pumps are still useful
                in some petrol-powered vehicles as they increase hydraulic support for the brakes. They can also be used
                to power the motors that control the air flow in car ventilation systems, the throttle driver in cruise
                control systems and even the central locking system. Whether responsible for your brakes or your
                security, a reliable vacuum pump is essential and should be immediately replaced if malfunctioning.</p>

                The Vacuum Pump is a device that helps enhance the effects of the hydraulic braking system in cars as a
                supplement to the primary braking mechanism. Each time you push the brake pedal, the force transfers to
                a rod. This rod passes through the brake booster and reaches the master cylinder. The pressure from the
                rod activates the master cylinder piston and works on the hydraulic braking systems. The Vacuum Pump
                chamber contains a vacuum the engine creates. This chamber has two sections, separated vertically by way
                of a rubber diaphragm. When the brake pedal pushes the rod, a small amount of air is let into the
                chamber on the brake pedal side through a valve that also seals off the vacuum. This air pressure on one
                side of the diaphragm helps enhance the force of the brake. However, in case of cars that have turbo
                charging or use diesel as fuel, the engine does not create the necessary vacuum. Thus, they need an
                additional brake booster vacuum pump to draw out the air and create the vacuum needed for the brake
                booster to function. Vehicles that typically run in locations of high altitude also need a brake booster
                vacuum pump. The brake booster vacuum pump reduces dependency on the engine for the vacuum and can work
                independently of it. This device uses an electrical control circuit to work. It activates with a signal
                from the brake booster vacuum sensor that monitors the levels of the vacuum in the brake booster. The
                brake booster vacuum pump should be able to maintain up to 18 of vacuum for the brake booster to be
                effective. If you notice that the pedal has slipped to the floor of the car and you hear a hissing
                sound, this could be an indication of a leak in the air line or pump to the brake booster vacuum pump.

                Vacuum pump in the Opel Vectra B (in red) In many cases, vacuum pumps are located directly on the
                cylinder head, and are driven by the camshaft. Due to these interfaces, the engine repairer should have
                an elementary knowledge of vacuum pumps. Vacuum pumps are used in motor vehicles in which the necessary
                vacuum cannot be generated in the intake manifold. These are direct injection engines, turbo engines and
                engines with variable valve timing, for example. The increasing number of pneumatic actuators can also
                render the use of a vacuum pump necessary. With pneumatic devices, high actuating forces can be achieved
                in a small installation space. Brake boosters, secondary air valves, EGR valves, switched intake
                manifolds, turbocharger control and comfort devices are just some examples.

                provide power for other systems, most notably the brake system and in many cases, the air conditioning
                system.

                Vacuum leaks in today's computer-controlled engines can cause very serious engine damage. Because the
                vacuum leak pulls in outside air, immediately the fuel air ratio is altered to a lean condition. The
                lean air fuel condition is picked up by the exhaust oxygen sensors who, in turn, report this to the
                computer.
