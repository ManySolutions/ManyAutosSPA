                UK. We keep a very big tyre variety, all different sizes and brands! So Many Autos can easily find the
                perfect tyres, to your liking, very quickly!</p>
              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">When was the last time you checked your tyres?
                Take one minute of your time now and follow out these simple and easy checks.</p>
              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Tread Depth<br>
                The legal tread-depth should at least be 1.6 mm across 75% of the tyre surface. This depth is under
                constant review and can increase shortly. Tyre Pressure - Ensure your tyres are inflated to the right
                pressure. Under inflation can cause excessive wear over inflation can affect handling. Vehicle
                manufactures indicate the correct pressures for your vehicle and driving conditions. Surface Damage Look
                for flat spots on your tyres or damage, wall damage
                Kerb impacts in particular can cause great damage to tyre walls. An 'egg' on a tyre wall is an area of
                weakness and may be prone to a blow out! Failing to ensure the legality of your tyres can have numerous
                results. If you're stopped and a single tyre is found to be illegal a police officer can endorse your
                license. If it's more than one tyre you can end up in Court facing a potential ban! Worst case scenario
                an illegal tyre can get you killed. Here at Many Autos we're dedicated to providing our customers
                different tyre brands for very low prices. Top brand, high quality tyres are in stock ready for a
                fitting here in the UK.</p>

                You should inspect your tyres regularly at least once a month. Check the below to see if your tyres need
                replacing: Tread wear bars: most tyres have tread wear bars - bands of hard rubber that you can only see
                when your tread depth has gone beyond the limit for safe driving, which is generally 1.6mm.

                The minimum legal tread depth is 1.5 mm across the width of the tread. When the tyre is worn to the
                legal limit the bars will be flush with the surface of the tread. While that is the legal requirement
                some car manufacturers recommend you replace your tyres before they wear to that extent.

                Take the 20p coin test. All you have to do is insert a 20p coin into the main tread grooves of your
                tyre. If the outer band of the 20p coin is hidden when it is inserted, then your tread is above the
                legal limit. If the outer band can be seen, it is highly likely your tyres need replacing as soon as
                possible. Are my tyres bald? When a tyre's tread is completely worn down to the wear bars, you have a
                bald tyre. And if your vehicle has bald tyres, you need new tyres right away-driving on bald tyres is
                not safe.

                Information At Many Autos, we understand that when you have a problem with a tyre you want a quality
                service, expert advice, value for money and the convenience of a local solution available 6 days a week.
                We also appreciate that choosing the right tyre can be confusing, from choosing the right size, to
                selecting a tyre and brand that will be fit for purpose from the extensive range available. To help you,
                our tyre experts have developed some general information to help you look after your tyres. When you
                think about it, your tyres are the only point of contact your vehicle has with the road. That’s why it’s
                vitally important that you select the right tyre type for the vehicle you are driving and for the
                purpose it is being used. We believe that motorists should get in to a habit of checking all four tyres
                every two weeks for correct tyre pressure, tread wear and general condition; and if you have one, don’t
                forget to check the spare tyre too.

                Choose wisely Choosing the right tyres can have a huge impact on how long they're likely to last. Tyres
                that are optimised to reduce rolling resistance and improve fuel economy will typically last longer, as
                they help to minimise friction with the road. If you can, stick to the same brand of tyres on all four
                wheels. Not all tyres are made in the same way; each tyre manufacturer will use different processes and
                materials and will therefore wear at different rates. Avoid bumps and scrapes Sharp edges on the
                pavement could result in a puncture or damage to the tyre, so take care when parking. Avoid mounting the
                kerb unless absolutely necessary this can damage the tyre and knock your wheels out of alignment.

                Driving style can seriously affect the lifespan of your tyres, as can the climate and condition of the
                roads. Accelerating aggressively, braking sharply and taking corners at speed is not only dangerous, but
                will also lead to more tyre wear.

                  A great way to get the most out of your tyres is to reduce the weight in your car. Your tyres are
                  already carrying the weight of the engine, the chassis, the driver and any passengers. By emptying the
                  boot of all the things, you don't need, you'll reduce the strain on your tyres (and your wallet - a
                  lighter car will also help to reduce fuel consumption
