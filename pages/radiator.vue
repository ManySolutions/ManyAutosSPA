              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Car radiator stops the engine from getting too hot. If it starts
                leaking or is damaged, this could spell disaster for your vehicle. If this happens, replace your car
                radiator as soon as possible. The engine in your car generates a lot of heat. If it gets too hot, the
                pistons will generate too much friction, which in turn may seize your engine. To prevent this problem,
                you can use water and anti-freeze to absorb heat by passing through your engine. These liquids make
                their way to the radiator which then transfers the heat into the atmosphere. The radiator helps preserve
                the life of your engine. A good one will preserve it for longer, as well as helping your car to run at
                its most efficient. The most obvious sign of a faulty radiator is a visible leak. If you see puddles of
                red or green liquid (engine coolant) forming underneath your engine when your car is stationary, you
                must replace your radiator immediately. Not doing so will cause serious damage. You should also bear in
                mind that engine coolant is toxic to both humans and animals. Low pressure is a sign that your car
                radiator is suffering from corrosion. Your radiator should produce between 10 PSI and 12 PSI. If the
                pressure level is lower than this, then you have a problem.</p>

                There are several components which make a car radiator and any one of these parts could break and cause
                the whole system to fail. To help you understand more about car radiators and car radiator repair, we
                have written this simple guide.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                A car radiator is responsible for circulating coolant around the system. Without the radiator, a car
                would quickly run into trouble and serious problems could arise. The radiator is one part of many that
                makes up the cooling system and there are several functions that it carries out to keep a car’s engine
                at a safe temperature.

                Cooling fan repair Replacement
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                The cooling fan or cooling fans are mounted onto the back of the car radiator on the side closest to the
                engine. The cooling fans are in place to direct air into the engine efficiently from the radiator,
                mostly when a car has stopped or is going slowly. This is to suck cold air into the engine and ensure
                the temperature does not rise too much. Modern cooling fans are connected to the on-board computer
                present in cars. Temperature sensors will feed information to the computer as a car is being driven and
                make changes to the speed of the rotors if required. If a cooling fan needs to be repaired, the
                likelihood is that one of the rotors has broken or there has been an electrical fault which should not
                be too expensive to repair.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Engine coolant is a liquid that runs through a car engine to maintain the correct temperature for a car
                to operate properly. Engine coolant can become contaminated and will be significantly less effective.
                That is why it is important to check if the engine warning light comes on as this may be the result of
                engine coolant not doing its job properly and the engine coolant needs to be topped up. If a car is
                overheating, leaking engine coolant could also be a cause as holes can open from rust causing damage to
                the piping in the system.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                A radiator flush is performed to remove old engine coolant from the car radiator when new engine coolant
                is required. The job can be carried out using water to flush the radiator or a professional mechanic can
                use a special machine to perform the job. A radiator flush can resolve a lot of issues and it is a
                simple job to carry out. If a radiator flush is all that your car needs, it will not be an expensive job
                as there are not extra parts required and there is very little labour involved in the work.

                If there is a leak in your car radiator, engine coolant will seep out and you will have to have the
                problem resolved immediately. If coolant is leaking out of the car radiator, the car engine will
                overheat quickly and when this happens, a huge number of other issues could be caused. A radiator leak
                is not a difficult problem to resolve if you catch the problem early on, however, if you ignore the
                issue and allow the radiator leak to get worse, you’ll end up paying a huge amount of money for a
                radiator leak or car radiator leak replacement.

                When should you consider a Radiator replacement?

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Over time problems can occur with the radiator as it is subject to significant temperature fluctuations.
                Older cars were fitted with brass side tanks and a brass or copper, which were particularly prone to
                rust and leaks. Modern cars are generally fitted with plastic side tanks which, on the other hand, are
                prone to crack and can also leak engine coolant. A leaking radiator should be addressed as soon as
                possible seeing that a lower level of engine coolant can lead to an overheating engine and severe engine
                damage. Additionally, radiators can also clog up with dirt, leading to the engine overheating as less
                coolant can run through the radiator. Should you experience an issue like this or those listed earlier,
                it is advisable to have the radiator inspected and, if necessary, have it replaced. Seeing that the
                radiator is a component that is especially prone to wear it should always be serviced as and when
                stipulated in the guidelines set out by your car's manufacturer.

                Do not drive with leaking coolant since the radiator cools the engine, a cracked radiator may not cool
                the engine like it is supposed to. This can cause the engine heat to rise, and eventually the vehicle
                will overheat. You should have your coolant system checked before you continue to drive.
