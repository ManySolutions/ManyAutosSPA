              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Your car warranty will not be affected by using Many Autos. Due to a change in law in 2002, car
                manufacturers are not permitted to stop you using an independent garage to service or repair your car.
                we would advise following your manufacturer’s scheduling and using official manufacturer parts. This may
                increase the cost slightly, but you’ll always get a better deal than you would by going to a
                manufacturer. For more information please contact us on info@manyautosltd.com or call our team on

                turning on additional lights, the air con and the wipers, it may stay on. As the alternator really
                begins to pack up, those same systems may not function properly or stop working altogether. Since so
                many things are powered by electricity, you’d be surprised what can stop working, including vital
                instruments. However, it’s likely things will start failing in a pre-determined sequence with comfort
                features such as heated seats being the first to stop and the headlights, the last. If you pull over and
                raise the bonnet with the engine still running you might smell the alternator overheating, hear it
                making a grouching or whining noise or even, if you haven’t had it checked recently, see the rubber belt
