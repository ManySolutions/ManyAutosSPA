              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Given that both your brake hose and pipe play a vital role in helping
                your brakes to function, it's only right that your vehicle won't pass its MOT if they are worn out. The
                brake hose carries hydraulic fluid from the brake pipe to the callipers, forcing the callipers together
                and clamping the brake pads around the rotors when you place your foot on the brake pedal. The brake
                pipe is a rigid (usually steel – which can corrode over time) pipe that transfers pressurised brake
                fluid from the master cylinder, where brake fluid is stored, to the brake hoses. The brake hose is made
                of flexible, reinforced rubber piping that is designed to withstand oil and water as well as the high
                pressure exerted when the braking system is in use; however, being constantly exposed to the elements
                and in regular movement, it will, eventually, wear out. It’s essential to replace a worn hose or braking
                will be affected; this safety issue would result in a failed MOT. Brake failure is certainly not worth
                the risk. Make sure you check the integrity of your braking system regularly.</p>

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                As most brake lines in the majority of cars are made from rubber, they are prone to deteriorate over
                time. Rubber brake lines can become brittle and hard, causing brake fluid to leak out of the system. In
                this case, the hose should be replaced as soon as possible to ensure a fully functioning braking system.
                In high performance cars the brake lines are usually made of metal, in most cases one would see braided
                brake lines which are usually a little tougher. Servicing the brake lines is key to ensure a fully
                functioning brake system. Always service the brakes according to the guidelines set out by your car's
                manufacturer. If you experience trouble when braking, you ought to seek the help of an expert. Brake
                problems can, of course, potentially lead to dangerous situations.

                Checking the condition of your car's brake pipes is a job that is all too easy to forget because the
                pipes are mostly hidden underneath the car. However, these pipes can deteriorate to the point where they
                start to leak, causing a dangerous loss of brake fluid and eventually partial or even complete failure
                of the braking system. Checking the condition of your car's brake pipes is a job that is all too easy to
                forget because the pipes are mostly hidden underneath the car. However, these pipes can deteriorate to
                the point where they start to leak, causing a dangerous loss of brake fluid and eventually partial or
                even complete failure of the braking system. If you find that you need to keep topping up the brake
                fluid reservoir more often than usual, then there is a leak somewhere in the brake system. You should
                immediately check the whole system thoroughly to find and repair the source of the leak. If you find a
                fluid leak at one of the unions joining a rigid brake pipe to a flexible brake hose, you may be able to
                stop it simply by tightening the union. If this fails, or if the pipe itself seems to be the source of
                the leak, then the only cure is to replace that section of pipe. But you should first check the
                condition of all the brake pipes because you will probably find that, if one pipe has become so corroded
                that it has started to leak, the other pipes will also be in poor condition. The only safe course then
                is to replace all the brake pipes.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Make a systematic check of all the pipes by starting at the brake fluid reservoir and working down
                towards the brakes themselves, checking each length of pipe in turn. Wire-brush away the rust to find
                the extent of the damage. Wipe the pipe clean of any oily deposits, then run your hands along the pipe
                to feel for damage - in particular if the pipe feels flattened or corroded at any point. If the surface
                feels rough because of corrosion, rub it with fine wet-or-dry paper or use a wire brush to see how deep
                the corrosion goes. Light surface rust is acceptable but if the rust has eaten its way into the metal,
                the pipe has to be renewed. Where a pipe passes through a bulkhead, check that the grommet holding it
                there is still in position. If the grommet has come out the pipe will chafe against the side of the hole
                and may wear through. Make sure the pipe is not damaged and if all is well relocate the grommet. You can
                glue the grommet in place with impact adhesive if it is prone to becoming loose.

                Your car will probably have metric brake unions, but it is important to confirm this because they may be
                imperial. Compare the brake unions on your car with the ones shown above to find out which type they
                are. In most modern cars, the unions between the pipes and hoses are metric, but you may have an older
                car that is fitted with imperial thread unions. If you are in doubt, it is important to find out before
                you start work which type your car has because the flares on the ends of the pipes are shaped
                differently depending on whether the union is metric or imperial.

                Worn Brake Pads: If you suspect fluid is leaking because the level in the reservoir is low, it might be

                piston remains farther out due to the reduced pad material). Damaged Bleeder Valve: Each caliper has a
                bleeder.

                Brake hoses create a flexible connection between brake pipes and wheel brakes. They transmit the
                hydraulic pressure to the wheel cylinders and brake callipers. Brake hoses are usually made form a
                special inner and outer rubber with a multi-layer fabric insert in between.

                Why Brake Fluid Leaks Are Dangerous. Occasionally a brake system will develop a leak and if left
                unchecked for long enough this can cause some serious safety concerns. Fortunately, modern cars have a
                warning light which illuminates on your dash when the fluid level drops too low.

                However, if you're losing brake fluid, you need to check for a leak in the wheel cylinders or the brake
                lines. Wetness and streaks of dried fluid are signs of trouble. If you see rust spots on your lines,
                gently sand them off. Also look for thin places under those spots that may turn into holes before long.
