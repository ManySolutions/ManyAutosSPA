              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">A head gasket is effectively a seal which is essential for
                maintaining the temperature and integrity of a car engine. It's a part responsible for sealing pressure
                within the engine as well as the distribution of oil and coolant. Every time you turn on your engine the
                head gasket must operate within very high temperatures and pressures, which is exactly what it is
                designed to do. The engine of your car needs to be cooled constantly as it relies on combustion for
                power and the head gasket is the core component in performing this job. If the head gasket is damaged,
                the engine will quickly overheat, and serious damage will be caused. Overheating in the engine of your
                car will lead to a loss of compression, the mixing of oil, water, coolant as well as a reduction in
                lubrication. The head gasket is a very complex piece of equipment and so a variety of materials are
                needed to build it. It must be able to withstand and function normally at extreme temperatures and
                pressure, it also needs to be resistant to all the chemicals and oils which rush around your car engine.
                As a result, each gasket from one car to the next is different as the demands of each engine are unique.
                Car manufacturers spend millions of pounds every year in the research and development of head gaskets to
                help manage the pressure and cooling of engines. Unfortunately, if you need a head gasket repairing, it
                will be on the more expensive side.</p>

                Once the head gasket blows or becomes damaged, your car will officially become a time bomb of serious
                mechanical destruction. The longer your vehicle is operated with a blown head gasket, the more damage is
                likely to occur to the engine. Once the head gasket blows there will be an immediate loss of pressure in
                the engine. As mentioned above, the head gasket acts as a seal, maintaining pressure in the piston
                chamber. Once the head gasket blows, pressure can escape. Since the pressure in the combustion chamber
                is what keeps the pistons firing with force, the driver should notice an immediate loss of power and
                notice other performance issues such as decreased fuel efficiency. When the head gasket blows, the oil
                and coolant passageways will start to leak, allowing both liquids to enter places where they do not
                belong and causing more extensive damage. Coolant can enter the combustion chambers and mix with motor
                oil, causing dilution of the motor oil while at the same time robbing coolant from the cooling system,
                ultimately causing the engine to overheat. Coolant is not a lubricant, so the more coolant that mixes
                with the motor oil, the less lubricated are the moving parts of a car and the more quickly disaster is
                likely to happen.

                The head gasket in effect seals the cylinder head to the cylinder block of the car. It ensures that
                pressure inside the cylinder chambers stays optimal. It also prevents oil or water leaks from occurring
                where the water and oil channels of the cylinder head and block meet. The part is therefore an extremely
                important part of the engine as it can make the difference between an engine running well, or badly.

                A blown Head Gasket means that the seal between the cylinders and the other parts of the engine (most
                commonly the cooling system) has been broken. This can lead to rough running and, more significantly,
                overheating, which can cause significant engine damage..

                There are products on the market to seal a blown head gasket, but we don't recommend them. They may
                provide a temporary fix but can block your cooling system, thus causing further damage. Can a bad
                thermostat cause a blown head gasket? A head gasket failure may be caused by an engine overheating one
                too many times as a result of a clogged radiator, coolant leak, faulty fan, but the blown head gasket
                can also cause the engine to overheat. Will a blown head gasket cause a misfire? A head gasket that
                fails between cylinders will generally cause a misfire and perhaps few other symptoms. Lowered
                compression results in a rough idling engine. Damage of this type may not cause overheating, coolant in
                the oil or any other outward sign. What does white smoke from the tailpipe usually indicate? Smoke of
                this sort is usually caused by the engine burning coolant and can be the result of a blown head gasket
                or a damaged cylinder head, or a cracked engine block, which requires a new engine, or an engine
                rebuild. Is a leaking head gasket bad? A leaking head gasket can cause a lot of problems with your car.
                Whether the leak is external, causing a water leak into your engine bay, or internal, causing coolant to
                be pulled into your combustion chamber, losing coolant can lead to a dangerous situation in your
                vehicle.

                First, it can foul spark plugs and make your engine run poorly due to the deposits left by burning
                coolant. Leaking coolant and combustion gases can cause high temperature gradients leading to erosion of
                the leak area and possible cracking. For all these reasons we don't recommend driving with a blown head
                gasket. How do you know if your Head Gasket is going? Common symptoms of a blown head gasket include the
                following: 1. External leaks of coolant from under the exhaust gasket. 2. Overheating under the hood. 3.
                Smoke blowing from the exhaust with a white tint. 4. Depleted coolant levels with no trace of leakage.
                5. Bubble formations in the radiator and overflow compartment.

                It isn't cheap to fix a blown head gasket to repair the head gasket, a mechanic has to disassemble the
                top portion of the engine and the process often takes a few days to complete. Does a blown head gasket
                ruin an engine? The main cause for a blown or damaged head gasket is extreme engine temperature. High
                engine temperatures are often caused by a coolant leak or just not having enough coolant in the
                radiator. It is important to note that different head gaskets will falter at different stages and
                temperatures. Can a bad thermostat cause a blown head gasket? A head gasket failure may be caused by an
                engine overheating one too many times as a result of a clogged radiator, coolant leak, faulty fan, but
                the blown head gasket can also cause the engine to overheat.

                Five Causes for a Blown Head Gasket
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                1. Overheating The biggest cause of a blown head gasket is overheating. Usually, the head gasket around
                the cylinders can become crushed, and if this happens, the seal is lost, and your engine will lose
                compression, leak coolant, and the gasket will erode. Before replacing the head gasket, it’s vital that
                you find the cause of the overheating. It could be due to coolant leaks in the engine, the hoses, the
                radiator, or the water pump. These must be found and repaired. It could also be due to the cooling fan
                not working or the radiator being clogged. Again, these need to be fixed or, likely, you’ll end up with
                another blown head gasket again shortly after your repair. 2. Installation Error If you’ve had a blown
                head gasket replaced on your car and solved the problem of why it blew in the first place, the likely
                cause this time will be installation error. This is not particularly uncommon. The head bolts need to be
                tightened in the correct sequence and set to the proper torque. They also need to have clean threads
                that aren’t stretched or damage. The cylinder head surfaces and engine block also need to be smooth,
                clean, and flat. Any one of these factors, or a combination of them, can cause a blown head gasket.
                Remember, too, that sealer should only be used on non-coated, one-piece steel head gaskets. However,
                establishing this as the cause can be difficult. You’ll need to eliminate other possibilities first. 3.
                Hot Spots There are engines that are prone to hot spots between the centre cylinders in the cylinder
                head, although aftermarket head gaskets for these engines are reinforced to lessen the possibility of a
                blown head gasket. However, if you have an older car, the hot spot could be the cause especially if your
                old head gasket has been replaced by one that’s not reinforced. 4. Pre-ignition Problems Pre-ignition
                problems can cause this problem as well, especially if you only use your car for city driving. With
                pre-ignition, there’s a hot spot in the chamber which causes ignition of the fuel before the spark plug
                has a chance to fire. It could also be due to detonation. This happens if the spark timing is too
                advanced or the fuel mixture isn’t rich enough. It causes carbon deposits to build up and ultimately
                erodes and blows the part. 5. Bad Head Gasket In some cases, the original head gasket for the car can
                just be very badly designed and the poor design can cause a blown head gasket over a period. A little
                research will establish if your vehicle is prone to poor designs. Once you replace it with a good head
                gasket, you should not experience any further failures.
