              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">A brake disc is usually an iron (or carbon composite) disc that is
                attached to the suspension of a car, motorcycle or even bicycle and is gripped by brake pads held in a
                brake calliper. The friction between the brake disc and the pads is what brings the car to a halt. The
                brake disc has numerous advantages over the brake drum, because it dissipates heat quickly, giving
                strong and consistent braking performance. Disc brakes also give the driver more ‘feel’ at the pedal,
                allowing him or her to more easily modulate the pressure for a smooth stop. In higher-performance
                applications, a brake disc will comprise two discs attached side by side by various rotors. This, in
                effect, makes the disc ‘ventilated’ further helping to cool and performance. Brake discs are also
                commonplace on motorcycles, where they are drilled to improve wet-weather braking performance. Instead
                of the brake pad having to compress any water on the surface of the disc, which hampers stopping
                ability, the water is pushed into the holes on the disc, thereby allowing the brake pads to grip the
                disc as intended. As a way of avoiding the stresses associated with excess heat build-up during braking,
                some discs are sometime mounted almost loosely on to the hub via coarse splines. This loose mounting
                allows the disc to expand evenly with the heat, and stops it transferring too much heat to the hub on
                which it is mounted, which could cause a failure. Disc brake technology has advanced to the point where
                it is not only used on cars and motorcycles – pedal cycles now commonly have disc brakes as standard
                because these provide stronger and more consistent performance in adverse weather. Such braking systems
                are also light enough that they don’t impact on the overall performance of the bicycle.</p>

                5 Most Common Symptoms of Worn Brake Pads & Discs
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Brakes are the most important safety feature of your vehicle. They
                  can wear differently depending on vehicle and driving conditions, so it’s important to know the signs
                  of worn-out brakes. There are five major symptoms of worn brake pads & discs — and vehicle owners
                  should be aware of all five.</p>
                <h4 class="text-darker-blue">Vehicle Pulls to One Side When Stopping</h4>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">This issue can have a variety of causes, but the most common is a
                  stuck brake calliper. When this happens, the brakes never totally disengage, so you’re driving with a
                  constant, slight pressure on the brakes. If you suspect this problem, try putting your hand near your
                  wheels after you’ve just driven your car. Stuck brake callipers can cause heat to emanate from wheels
                  after driving. A stuck calliper can cause a lot of wear on your brakes and transmission, so don’t wait
                  to fix it.</p>
                <h4 class="text-darker-blue">Brake Pedal Feels Different</h4>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">If your brake pedal is softer than normal or sinks to the floor,
                  it’s a sign of serious trouble. It can mean a leaking master cylinder or brake lines. Check your brake
                  fluid levels, looking especially for leaks near the pedal, and seek professional advice immediately. A
                  pulsating brake pedal, meanwhile, usually indicates warped or out-of-tune brake discs.</p>
                <h4 class="text-darker-blue">Steering Wheel Shakes When Stopping</h4>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">This common problem is usually the result of warped front brake
                  discs or brake pad impressions. Since pads should be flat and even, impressions or indents can cause a
                  shaky stop. Pad impressions can form when a vehicle sits for a prolonged period of time without being
                  driven. This is especially common in hot temperatures and high humidity. Unless your brakes are rusty,
                  this problem often requires only some refinishing work.</p>
                <h4 class="text-darker-blue">Entire Car Shakes When Stopping</h4>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">This is usually an issue with the car’s rear brakes. Your rear
                  brake drums might need resurfacing and replacement. These and other brake maintenance tasks can be
                  done at home. But it’s much easier and safer to take it to the professionals. Contact Many Autos for
                  your car’s full-service. We do brake pads, brake discs, cylinders, and more. If you’ve got worn brake

                Never Ignore These 8 Warning Signs of Brake Problems
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                <h4 class="text-darker-blue">1. Brake Light On</h4>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">When one of the red or yellow brake indicators on your dashboard
                  lights up it may mean you’re just due for an inspection. It could also be your vehicle’s smart
                  electronics alerting you to a problem. An engaged parking brake could also cause the light to go on.
                  Be sure it’s fully released to confirm that’s not the issue.</p>
                <h4 class="text-darker-blue">2. Squealing, Squeaking or Grinding Noises</h4>
                <h4 class="text-darker-blue padding-left-20">Hearing a Metallic Squeal While You’re in Motion?</h4>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify padding-left-20">That’s likely the sound of the brake pad wear
                  indicators. They’re made of steel, so they make this sound when they start If you start hearing a
                  high-pitched noise that stops when you apply the brakes contacting the rotor. They’re letting you know
                  that your pads are worn out and need to be replaced before you get rotor damage, which can be an
                  expensive fix.</p>
                <h4 class="text-darker-blue padding-left-20">Grinding Sound When Brakes Are Applied?</h4>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify padding-left-20">
                  Grinding that you also feel in the pedal could mean a number of things. There could just be some
                  gravel, or a rock caught in the calliper unit, easily remedied.<br>
                  But you may have gone too long without brake servicing. The brake pads may be worn through, and you’re
                  hearing metal on metal that could be creating grooves in the brake rotor. Not good.<br>
                  Grinding could also be an indicator of lack of lubrication in vehicles with rear drum brakes. The
                  brake shoe (the component that presses on the rotor to slow the vehicle) could be scraping on metal
                  contact points like the backing plate, due to rust. If you hear any of these sounds, get your brakes
                  looked at right away to head off more expensive problems
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-darker-blue">3. Wobbling, Vibration or Scraping When Braking</h4>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">
                  Shaking in the steering wheel or vibration when you apply the brakes may be the result of an uneven
                  rotor.<br> Brake rotors are big discs that sit inside of the wheels. When you hit the brake pedal, the
                  brake pads hug the rotors, slowing them and your vehicle. You want rotors to be smooth and completely
                  even in thickness. Over time and thousands of wheel revolutions, it’s normal for the rotor surface to
                  get slight variations. Rust can also sometimes develop. During brake servicing, the face of the rotor
                  is often trued (smoothed and evened out) to correct these flaws.<br>This work has to be done exactly
                  to your vehicle’s specifications. The tiniest differences in disc thickness — we’re talking
                  thousandths of an inch, about three sheets of paper in width — can cause a wobbly feeling when you
                  brake.
                  An uneven rotor surface may also cause the rotor to hit one of the brake pads as it spins, causing
                  some of the pad material to transfer onto the rotor in that spot. Then you’ll feel shaking when
                  braking, as the pad hits that bump in the rotor.<br> Another possible cause of rough braking is the
                  brake calliper not releasing properly. The job of a brake calliper is to squeeze the brake pads
                  against your brake rotors, which slows your vehicle down. It’s the motion of the piston inside the
                  calliper unit that causes this contact. <br>Due to wear from heat or road debris, the piston can get
                  sticky. It may not retract the pads back into the full “off” position when you let up on the brake
                  pedal.
                  A fourth cause of bumpy braking could be damage to your brake components from improper wheel lug nut
                  installation. (The lug nuts are the big bolts that clamp your tire and wheel onto the hub of your
                  car.) <br>Any time tires are removed, it’s crucial for the lug nuts to be put back on in the right
                  order, evenly, at just the right tightness (torque). It has to be done in a star pattern, with just
                  the right pressure. If not, you’ll get uneven, premature rotor wear and be back for service sooner
                  rather than later.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-darker-blue">4. Leaking Fluid</h4>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">If you’re experiencing a soft brake pedal, have a service
                  technician look for fluid leaking from the master cylinder or elsewhere in the brake system. The
                  master cylinder is the unit that creates the power for your brakes. It has a reservoir like the one
                  for your wiper fluid that contains brake fluid. When you apply the brakes, this fluid is pushed
                  through thin piping, creating hydraulic pressure. If fluid is leaking from this system, there may not
                  be enough power to force the brake pads to clamp hard to the rotors.</p>
                <h4 class="text-darker-blue">5. Spongy or Soft Brake Pedal</h4>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">If you notice a difference in the resistance in the brake pedal —
                  it feels “softer,” or sinks all the way to the floor mat when you press on it — it’s a sign you need
                  immediate service. There could be air or moisture in the braking system or a problem with the master
                  cylinder. Generally, in autos with power brakes the pedal should stop 1 to 1 ½ inches from the floor.
                  If you have manual brakes, the pedal should stop more than 3 inches from the floor</p>
                <h4 class="text-darker-blue">6. Car Pulling to One Side When Braking</h4>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">This could be caused by a brake hose gone bad or a calliper
                  problem. One brake calliper may be applying more or all the pressure during braking, resulting in
                  unbalanced stopping</p>
                <h4 class="text-darker-blue">7. Burning Smell While Driving</h4>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">
                  A sharp, chemical odour after repeated hard braking on steep roads is a sign of overheated brakes or
                  clutch. Pull over immediately in a safe place, check your parking brake to make sure it’s fully
                  released and allow the brakes to cool. If you don’t, you risk heating up the brake fluid to boiling,
                  which can cause brake failure. If there’s any smoke coming from a wheel, it may be a stuck brake
                  calliper and possibly unsafe to continue driving on without repairs.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-darker-blue">8. Bouncing Up and Down When You Stop Short</h4>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">
                  If your vehicle rocks or bounces with sharp braking, it’s probably not a brake problem at all. Your
                  shock absorbers may need to be replaced.<br>Not every brake noise or symptom is going to cost you. It
                  could be a harmless squeak from certain types of material in brake pads. There may be dust or moisture
                  somewhere in the braking system that isn’t causing damage. You may just need to add new brake
                  fluid.<br>
                  But you need to be sure.<br>Brake parts wear out over time. Self-diagnosing symptoms or delaying brake
                  servicing could put you and your passengers at unnecessary risk. And like with a lot of automotive
                  issues, if there is a problem, the longer you put it off the more you risk big repair bills.
