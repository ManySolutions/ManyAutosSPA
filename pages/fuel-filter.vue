              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">The fuel filter is one of the most important components of a modern
                combustion engine. They ensure that only clean fuel is sent to the engine by removing dirt, debris and
                other contaminants. Modern fuel systems are very sensitive to contaminants in the fuel and even the
                smallest particle can cause expensive damage by eroding the fuel pump, valves or injectors. Fuel filters
                also maximise performance as clean fuel burns more efficiently. It is recommended that the fuel filter
                is changed every 25,000 to 30,000 miles. However, this can vary depending on the car and the amount of
                driving. The purpose of fuel filters is to stop dirt and debris from getting into your engine and
                contaminating your fuel supply. To enhance and maintain your car’s performance, your car’s performance
                depends on a finely balanced mix of air and clean fuel. By keeping dirt at bay, your car’s fuel filters
                play a vital role in your car’s health and efficiency. Dirty, blocked, or worn fuel filters will
                compromise your car's performance. Failure to filter out dirt and debris could clog your fuel injectors
                and carburettor. This in turn could lead to damage and the need for costly repairs or replacement parts.
                It’s inexpensive and easy to replace your fuel filters, so don't leave it too late. Change yours
                regularly and buy a high-quality product to deliver full protection for your engine.</p>

                Benefits of Regularly Changing Fuel Filters
              </v-expansion-panel-header>

                <ul class="list mt-2 mb-2">
                  <li>The most noticeable benefit of a clean fuel filter is engine performance. Modern high-precision
                    fuel systems have very little tolerance to impurities in the fuel. These impurities can have a
                    severe abrasive effect on the engine components and negatively affect engine performance as a
                    result.</li>
                  <li>Clean fuel injectors spray a precise amount of fuel into the intake manifold. Impurities in the
                    fuel can easily block or destroy one of these injectors. Replacing a fuel filter according to
                    manufacturer’s guidelines can prevent this and prolong the life of such engine components.
                    Furthermore, injectors are far more expensive to buy and replace then fuel filters.</li>
                  <li>An engine can misfire due to an incorrect fuel to air mixture, as mentioned above, a clogged or
                    ineffective fuel filter can restrict the amount of fuel to the engine leading to an air heavy
                    mixture.</li>

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                When a fuel filter becomes clogged the fuel pump must work harder to pump sufficient fuel into the
                engine. A clogged fuel filter is more noticeable when the demand for fuel is higher than normal i.e.
                when driving up a hill or during acceleration. The fuel pump is put under increased pressure as it
                attempts to bring more fuel from a clogged and restrictive fuel filter. The following symptoms are also
                good indicators:
                <ol class="list mt-2 mb-2">
                  <li>Engine Will Not Start If the fuel filter is completely blocked the necessary amount of fuel may
                    not reach the engine for it to start. </li>
                  <li>Difficulty in Starting the Engine as the clogged filter is limiting the amount of fuel to the
                    engine it may take longer to start the engine than normal.</li>
                  <li>The flow of fuel to the engine may become inconsistent resulting in misfires or some hesitation
                    when trying to accelerate.</li>
                  <li>Stalling The engine may stall and come to a complete stop if the amount of fuel getting to the
                    engine is insufficient.</li>
                </ol>

                Always check your owner's manual to see what the vehicle manufacturer's recommended guidelines are for
                fuel filter replacement. Sources online estimate filters should be replaced as soon as every 20,000 up
                to 40,000 miles.

                Cars made prior to 1980 used mechanical fuel pumps and carburettors that required low fuel pressure to
                operate. Fuel filters keep contaminants and other particles from clogging the injectors.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Over time, a fuel filter can get rather dirty, clog up or fail completely. There will be a reduced flow
                of fuel towards the engine or, in extreme cases, dirty fuel will pass through the filter and onto the
                engine. Eventually, a fuel filter that does not work correctly can lead to further damage. Should you
                experience problems with the fuel supply, then it is advisable to have the fuel filter inspected and, if
                necessary, have it replaced. Seeing that the fuel filter is a component that is especially prone to wear
                it should always be replaced as and when stipulated in the servicing guidelines set out by your car's
                manufacturer.

                One of the first symptoms of a problem with the auxiliary fuel filter is hard starting. If the filter
                becomes excessively dirty or clogged it may restrict fuel pressure or flow, which may cause the vehicle
                to have trouble starting.

                    A fuel filter put in backwards may restrict or stop the flow of fuel to the engine. If, after
                    changing a fuel filter, the engine suddenly displays a loss of performance, the filter should be
                    inspected for proper installation.

                  <li class="text-teal text-18 justify">Would a bad fuel filter cause my car to die?</li>
                  Another common symptom of a problem with the fuel filter is engine performance issues. A severely
                  dirty or clogged fuel filter can cause the vehicle to experience misfires, a decrease in power and
                  acceleration, and even stalling.
                  <li class="text-teal text-18 justify">Can a bad fuel filter cause rough idle?</li>
                  If this happens the engine will not get enough fuel, which can cause a rough idle, sputtering,
                  stalling and even slow acceleration.
