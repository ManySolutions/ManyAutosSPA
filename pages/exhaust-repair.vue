                issue addressed immediately as the problem will only get worse. The exhaust is an essential component of
                your vehicle. It undergoes very strong thermal and mechanical stresses during its life. High
                temperatures and acidic exhaust fumes attack the internal wall of the exhaust system.</p>
              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">External corrosion and rust can be caused by rain and dirt on the
                underside of your vehicle. It’s also common for older exhausts to come loose from their supports. This
                can happen over time simply due to vibrations caused by driving. Therefore, it’s important to have your
                exhaust checked regularly by a trained technician. Any damage to your exhaust could cause your emissions
                to increase, which would result in your cars MOT failure.</p>

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Over the years, car manufacturers have been trying to find ways to reduce the harmful pollutants
                produced by vehicles. In 1975 they came up with the catalytic converter and this is now the most
                important part of a car’s emission control system. In 1993 it became the law in the UK for new cars to
                be sold with catalytic converters in order to meet European emissions standards. The catalytic converter
                is beneficial not just to the environment but also to your car’s performance. However, it’s essential to
                have it checked regularly as faulty cats are expensive to repair. The Lambda sensor works in conjunction
                with the catalytic converter to determine how much oxygen the car is using, so this also should be
                checked if you have an exhaust issue.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Since 2009, diesel cars have been required by EU law to be fitted with a diesel particulate filter, in a
                bid to reduce emissions and drive down air pollution. These devices catch the small pieces of soot
                released by burned fuel. Once they fill up, the soot is burned to ash – either by passive regeneration
                (when the exhaust temperature is hot enough to burn it) or active regeneration (a process initiated by
                the car). Diesel particulate filters have proven to be a very effective way to combat pollution.
                However, over time they can become worn out and defective. Additionally, vehicles produced before 2009
                may need to have them fitted before they can legally go on the road.

                Your exhaust is an essential safety system in your car. If parts of exhaust system break or become worn
                and aren’t replaced or repaired, this could result in harmful gases potentially being released around
                the driver, passengers, and surrounding environment, which can be a dangerous situation. As your
                vehicle’s exhaust is found on the outside of your car, it’s exposed to elements such as debris in the
                road that can sometimes cause damage, so it’s important to keep an eye on how your car is running.
                Thankfully, exhaust parts are relatively cheap and easy to maintain.

                Whether you’re looking for a reduction catalyst or an oxidization catalyst, you’re sure to find what you
                need in our range. Your engine uses catalysts in a number of ways. This includes helping to make sure
                the gases your car produces have as much oxygen in them as possible – your reduction catalyst is
                responsible for removing nitrogen atoms. Other functions of a catalyst in your car are to reduce the
                level of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide produced. This is the responsibility of the
                oxidization catalyst. If you’re unsure about which type of performance catalyst you need, feel free to
                call our friendly team for advice.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Your Exhaust System performs 4 tasks: it reduces noise, it diverts waste gases away from driver and
                passengers, it improves performance and it reduces fuel consumption. The Catalytic Converter removes
                harmful gases such as Carbon Monoxide, and noise is reduced by the Silencer (or 'muffler) Finally, on
                Diesel cars, a 'Diesel Particulate Filter' (or DPF) captures tiny soot particles before they leave the
                exhaust pipe.

                Without an exhaust system, the first thing you would notice is the noise - which would be many times
                greater. Your engine is also designed to run with an exhaust's 'backpressure' on gases leaving the
                engine. Removing the backpressure reduces performance and burns more fuel. Finally, your car would emit
                dangerous levels of waste gas without one.

                The exhaust rusts for a couple of reasons: first, it is exposed to water, debris, salt and damage from
                materials thrown up from the road. Second, the exhaust undergoes extremes of heat and cold, as well as
                internal water vapor (a byproduct of internal combustion), all of which speed up the rusting process.

                    engine and mixing with fuel and being burnt, probably because of worn valve stem seals or piston
                    rings. White smoke indicates that coolant is entering the engine's cylinders, most likely due to a
                    cracked or warped head gasket.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Many Autos operate a fleet of pool cars with a dedicated driver, so
                  wherever we are collecting from, we need to be able to leave one of our pool vehicles either in your
                  work car park / parking space, or if in a residential area, we would need to be able to leave our car
                  either at your house or on the road with a permit if required. We would be grateful if you could bear
                  this in mind when booking to use our free Collection and delivery service</p>
