                system used on aircraft and on land vehicles, such as cars, motorcycles, trucks and buses. ABS operates
                by preventing the wheels from locking up during braking, thereby maintaining tractive contact with the
                road surface.</p>

                  pump which puts pressure on the brakes.</p>

                  tachometer that measures the rotational speed of a wheel and passes it to the car's Engine Control
                  Module (ECM).</p>
