              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Thermostat is a small and neglected part of a car. However, it
                performs an important function by controlling the temperature of the engine coolant valve. Thus, when it
                stops functioning, the car engine can get overheated and does not work anymore. Thus, once this
                thermostat begins to wear out, it should be replaced without much delay.</p>

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">The thermostat starts at a closed position when you start the
                  engine to help it reach operating temperature. As coolant temperature rises, it begins to open. The
                  opening allows hot coolant in the engine to flow into the radiator, while the water pump pushes
                  lower-temperature coolant from the radiator into the engine. When the lower-temperature coolant
                  reaches the thermostat container, the expanding fluid begins to contract, closing the thermostat’s
                  valve.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">During engine operation, though, the thermostat actually never
                  fully closes or opens, but gradually nears either state to control coolant flow, depending on engine
                  operating conditions. This allow the engine to operate at the best temperature. This ideal
                  engine-operating temperature accomplishes several goals: It helps engine oil to lubricate efficiently
                  and to remove harmful deposits. It reduces emissions and gas consumption and contributes to engine
                  performance. Thus, the thermostat has an impact on your engine's health and longevity.</p>

                </p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Engine temperature is monitored and maintained by a thermostat,
                  which needs to be protected from the heat of the engine. Automotive thermostats incorporate a small
                  pellet of wax that melts and expands at a set temperature, pushing open a cooling valve when the
                  optimum temperature is exceeded. Due to the precise sensitivity of this design, a quality thermostat
                  housing is essential, as even the slightest crack can lead to extensive engine damage. Often more
                  difficult to spot, old and worn thermostat gaskets can also cause temperature issues within your
                  engine. Quality gaskets are vital for sealing your thermostat and its housing together, safely and
                  securely. We’ve used of high-quality thermostat housing and gaskets to ensure you find the right fit
                  for your vehicle.</p>

                No. If it has been determined that there is a thermostat problem, it should be repaired right away.
                Failure to do so can cause substantial and costly damage to the engine.

                  replaced anytime you have major work done on the coolant system. It is convenient and costs little

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">OEM thermostats are the best ones to use and you can request your

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Any liquid-cooled car engine has a small device called the thermostat that sits between the engine and
                the radiator. The thermostat in most cars is about 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter. Its job is to block the
                flow of coolant to the radiator until the engine has warmed up.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Symptoms of a stuck open thermostat are slow to reach normal operating temperature and only warm air
                blowing from the heater. Symptoms of a stuck closed thermostat are engine over-heating and radiator
                boil-over. Yes, they can stick open or closed.

                Time how long it takes the engine to warm up enough to produce heat when the heater is turned on. If it
                takes more than five minutes for the heater to produce heat, it is a sign that the thermostat is stuck
                open, allowing all the coolant to flow all the time.

                The main purpose of a thermostat housing is to contain the engine thermostat and provide a coolant
                outlet to the radiator. In some cases, each radiator hose will be connected to a similar looking
                housing, with one serving as a coolant inlet and the other as an outlet.

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify"> Once the engine is completely cold, the radiator cap is loosened,
                  and enough coolant is drained from the radiator, so the coolant level is below the thermostat
                  housing.<br>
                  The thermostat housing is removed, and the thermostat and gasket are extracted. Note that some cars
                  have more than one cooling system thermostat and both might need replacement.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">All mounting surfaces on the thermostat housing are cleaned of old
                  gasket material. A new gasket is applied, and the thermostat is re-installed in the correct
                  orientation and with the temperature sensing cylinder facing downward towards the engine.<br>The
                  thermostat housing bolts are tightened to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specifications using a
                  calibrated inch-pound torque wrench.<br>The cooling system is refilled with the appropriate coolant
                  type and the system is fully bled of all air.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">The car engine run until the normal operating temperature is
                  reached, and while taking precautions with the hot coolant, the coolant level is rechecked while
                  confirming there is flow through the radiator either visually or with an infrared temperature gun.
                  This will confirm the thermostat is open. Finally, the engine is checked for leaks.</p>
