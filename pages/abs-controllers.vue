              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify" style="padding-top: 30px;">ABS controllers are the components that
                instruct the hydraulic
                units to stop wheel spin in a vehicle's ABS system. The ABS system in your car is operated by a
                specifically designed computer unit and by braking sensors that are triggered every time the
                brakes are applied. The computer unit is referred to as the ABS controller. In a split second,
                this controller detects the presence of wheel-spin from the sensors and automatically instructs
                the hydraulic system to stop it. This technology isn't 100 per cent reliable, so the computer
                can fail from time to time. If your wheels are spinning more than they should be, it could be a
                sign that your ABS controller needs replacing.</p>

                Wheel speed sensors feed an ABS computer to monitor if your wheels are skidding during braking. When the
                brake pedal is depressed,
                brake fluid flows through the master cylinder to the ABS pump and out to the wheels.

                pedal during hard stops, or if the vehicle loses traction.

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">The controller is a computer in the car. It watches the speed
                  sensors and controls the valves.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">There are many different variations and control algorithms for ABS
                  systems. We will discuss how one of the simpler systems works. The controller always monitors the
                  speed sensors. It is looking for decelerations in the wheel that are out of the ordinary. Right before
                  a wheel locks up, it will experience a rapid deceleration. If left unchecked, the wheel would stop
                  much more quickly than any car could. It might take a car five seconds to stop from 60 mph (96.6 kph)
                  under ideal conditions, but a wheel that locks up could stop spinning in less than a second. The ABS
                  controller knows that such a rapid deceleration is impossible, so it reduces the pressure to that
                  brake until it sees an acceleration, then it increases the pressure until it sees the deceleration
                  again. It can do this very quickly, before the tire can significantly change speed. The result is that
                  the tire slows down at the same rate as the car, with the brakes keeping the tires very near the point
                  at which they will start to lock up. This gives the system maximum braking power. When the ABS system
                  is in operation you will feel a pulsing in the brake pedal; this comes from the rapid opening and
                  closing of the valves. Some ABS systems can cycle up to 15 times per second.</p>
