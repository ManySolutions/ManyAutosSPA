                servicing, MOT and repair needs. Full Service includes a comprehensive 70-point check, Interim Service
                has a 50-point check. At Many Autos we use the latest equipment, allowing our qualified technicians and
                mechanics to diagnose any problems quickly and efficiently. Forgetting to service the vehicle as per
                manufacturer schedule can cause airborne debris such as leaves and dust to find their way into the
                engine, in particular the cylinders. This grime can then mix with the engine oil, which, when moves
                around the engine can slowly wear away engine components due to its abrasive nature. If left for a while
                clogged filters can cause serious damage to engine, reducing its performance and costing you more money
                than the cost of a normal service. At Many Autos we keep a range of different service parts in stock for
                every make and model, so you can get the service you need to keep the vehicle engine running at the
                highest possible standard. For more information please visit our<a

                  Bracknell. An automotive charging system is made up of three major components the battery, the
                  voltage
                  regulator and an alternator. The alternator works with the battery to generate power for the
                  electrical components of a vehicle, like the interior and exterior lights, and the instrument panel.
                  An alternator gets its name from the term alternating current (AC). Alternators are typically found
                  near the front of the engine and are driven by the crankshaft, which converts the pistons' up-and-down
                  movement into circular movement. For more information please visit our <a

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">We do head gasket repairs and replacements for the Bracknell
                  area.
                  Once the head gasket blows or becomes damaged, your car will officially become a time bomb of serious
                  mechanical destruction. The longer your vehicle is operated with a blown head gasket, the more damage
                  is likely to occur to the engine. Once the head gasket blows there will be an immediate loss of
                  pressure in the engine. As mentioned above, the head gasket acts as a seal, maintaining pressure in
                  the piston chamber. Once the head gasket blows, pressure can escape. Since the pressure in the
                  combustion chamber is what keeps the pistons firing with force, the driver should notice an immediate
                  loss of power and notice other performance issues such as decreased fuel efficiency. When the head
                  gasket blows, the oil and coolant passageways will start to leak, allowing both liquids to enter
                  places where they do not belong and causing more extensive damage. Coolant can enter the combustion
                  chambers and mix with motor oil, causing dilution of the motor oil while at the same time robbing
                  coolant from the cooling system, ultimately causing the engine to overheat. Coolant is not a
                  lubricant, so the more coolant that mixes with the motor oil, the less lubricated are the moving parts
                  of a car and the more quickly disaster is likely to happen. For more information please visit our <a
