              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Glow plugs are standard fare in diesel engines and are designed to act like small electric heaters. They glow and emit heat in the combustion chamber, warming the engine block and helping the engine to start within a few seconds. Also known as diesel spark plugs, a glow plug takes the place of spark plugs which are only used in petrol engines. This is because diesel combusts in hot high-pressure air rather than under a spark. If you're after new glow plugs for your diesel vehicle, we've got everything you need. Speak to a member of our team who'll be able to point you in the right direction. Glow plugs look very similar to spark plugs, but a glow plug functions by adding additional energy to heat and start a diesel engine. Unlike petrol engines, which use a spark to ignite the fuel mixture, diesel engines rely solely on cylinder pressures to ignite the diesel fuel mixture. If there are problems with your glow plugs, it is important to get them replaced as it will affect how your vehicle starts. On cold wintery mornings, fully functioning glow plugs are essential for a successful ignition. In case your glow plugs fail, and you get stuck in the cold with an engine that will not start.</p>

                How do you know there is something wrong with the glow plugs?

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Glow plugs start your car and remain hot to keep the engine working. A problem with the glow plugs will usually mean you can't start your vehicle, or the engine is less efficient. This depends on the number of cylinders affected, but you will notice a loss in miles per gallon and higher emissions.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Glow plugs, like spark plugs, should be maintained according to the manufacturer recommended service schedule. This will mean that the glow plugs are usually replaced every few years, and it will help keep the rest of your vehicle running just as smoothly.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                In a nutshell, slow starting, and complete failure to start. Once the vehicle does start, missing, rough idle, hesitation, and lots of white smoke until the engine warms. If you have a four-cylinder, one glow plug bad will cause slight hard starting and a miss. Two will cause a very hard start and very rough operation.

                The glow plugs on a diesel engine will usually last around 40,000 miles but can fail before then. The following are some of the signs that you will notice when it is time to have your glow plugs replaced. The diesel vehicle is hard to start during cold weather. There is more smoke coming from the vehicle than normal.

               Your diesel vehicle is equipped with glow plugs, and with a Glow Plug Light that will either come on and stay on, or flash or blink when a fault is detected by the ECU (engine management unit). When the Glow Plug Light comes on, the ECU stores information about the condition that has caused it to come on.

                Are glow plugs only used for starting?
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Glow plugs in model engines differ from those in full size diesel engines. Full size engines only use the glow plug for starting. Model engines use a glow plug as an integral part of the ignition system because of the catalytic effect of the platinum wire, on the methanol base fuel they are designed to run on.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Instead of using spark plugs to incite combustion, diesel engines rely on cylinder pressure and temperature to ignite the fuel mixture. Usually a bad or failing glow plug will produce a few symptoms that can alert the driver of a potential issue.

                How long to let glow plugs warm up?
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Heating the glow plugs takes up to 15 seconds. The "wait to start" light won't go out until the glow plugs are ready. During cold weather, the glow plugs will take longer to heat. Check the glow plugs or intake heater before the cold weather season to ensure your car will start during cold days. Can glow plugs affect performance? Engine misfires or decrease in power and acceleration. If the glow plugs malfunction they will not provide the additional heat that aids in diesel combustion, which may cause the engine to experience misfires. The misfires may cause a loss in power, acceleration, and even fuel efficiency.

                Do glow plugs wear out?
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
               Usually, the glow plugs on a diesel engine will last around 60,000 miles, but in some cases will wear out before then. The continuous use that these plugs get is a major factor in why they will usually burn out quickly. Due to the location of the glow plugs, it can be a bit difficult to check them.
