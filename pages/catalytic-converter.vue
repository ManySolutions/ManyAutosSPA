              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">We all try and do our bit for the environment, and surprisingly, our
                cars are fitted with various parts which try and do the same. Catalytic converters help to remove
                harmful gases from our exhaust system before they hit the air, which makes them a pretty useful
                component. It's good to keep your catalytic converter happy, as it's often checked over as part of your
                cars MOT. For best practice and to keep your vehicle in ideal condition, Many Autos recommends you have
                exhaust system checked at least twice a year for cracks, leaking joints, broken hangers, worn rubber
                mountings, corrosion, failed gaskets and other damage or wear. After we have completed your inspection,
                we will provide you with a written report and a quote for any work which is required. Over the years,
                car manufacturers have been trying to find ways to reduce the harmful pollutants produced by vehicles.
                In 1975 they came up with the catalytic converter – and this is now the most important part of a car’s
                emission control system. In 1993 it became the law in the UK for new cars to be sold with catalytic
                converters in order to meet European emissions standards, now cars are often produced with multiple cats
                as standards become more stringent. The catalytic converter is beneficial not just to the environment
                but also to your car’s performance. However, it’s essential to have it checked regularly as faulty cats
                are expensive to repair. The Lambda sensor works in conjunction with the catalytic converter to
                determine how much oxygen the car is using, so this also should be checked if you have an exhaust issue.

                A plugged catalytic converter will only in extreme cases prevent you from driving your car. You can
                usually drive your car indefinitely with a partially plugged converter, though you will see a drop-in
                performance.

                Catalytic converters change harmful emissions into harmless gas, and they need to be replaced only if
                they become clogged or otherwise damaged and can't function properly. They're expensive to replace, so
                they aren't considered a regular maintenance item. A damaged “cat” should trigger a Check Engine light.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Misfire from bad spark plugs/wires, or an excessively rich fuel mixture are the leading causes. Once a
                catalytic converter has gone bad, you'll probably get a check engine light, and fail emissions tests. As
                things get worse, you can expect a bad smell, loss of power, poor acceleration, engine stalling, etc.

                Bad spark plugs or damaged exhaust valves can also destroy a catalytic converter. However, if your
                converter is completely clogged, your engine will quickly fail because of all the exhaust back pressure.

                A bad or failing catalytic converter can also cause an illuminated Check engine Light. The oxygen and
                air fuel ratio sensors that modern vehicles are designed with monitor the efficiency of the catalytic
                converter by monitoring the gas levels in the exhaust.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                The most common cause is unburned fuel entering the catalytic converter. Also, faulty spark plugs and
                leads will cause the engine to misfire and ruin the catalytic converter. The excess fuel will enter the
                exhaust system and cause it to overheat.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Unless the converter is clogged and physically prevents the exhaust gases from escaping, it cannot
                directly block the engine. A bad cat could result in the engine cutting off altogether, but it's not
                likely, because the owner usually gets the bad cat replaced before it gets to the point the engine won't
                run at all.

                It can also burn holes in exhaust system components and destroy your vehicle's catalytic converter. And,
                of course, it can also be a fire hazard if the vehicle is parked over anything that is flammable.
