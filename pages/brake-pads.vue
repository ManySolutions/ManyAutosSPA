              Importance of brake pads and what role they play in your car</h1>
            <p class="text-teal text-18 justify mb-15">
                We offer a free brake health check with every service we carry out.
                Our qualified technicians are specifically trained for this, so you know that you are getting an expert
                service. Our preferred parts for brake repairs are either <strong>buy genuine brake pads</strong> or the best quality
                parts only. We endeavor to replace these when a <NuxtLink to="/brake-pad-sensor">brake service</NuxtLink> is required, as we believe it is important
                to ensure your brakes are working as well as they possibly can. In the past, car owners/driver did
                believe for one that <strong>brake pads for lifetime</strong>, but this is not the case as are a standard wear and tear
                part. The brakes are one of the most important parts of a car so <strong>brake repair</strong> is vital. While it is a
                pain if the air condition does not work, and inconvenient when the engine fails or completely stops
                operating, you really need your brakes to be in full working order to avoid any nasty accidents. We have
                all heard that tell-tale screeching sound from brakes in need of repair, if not from our own car then
                from someone else’s. Other signs that your brakes need a service include the pedal “sinking” to the
                floor or feeling spongy, pulling to one side while braking or a grinding sound when you apply the
                brakes. All of these are signs that you should have your brakes checked as soon as possible.

              How the braking system works in your car</h2>
            <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">
              When thinking about the braking system of a car, most people are unaware of the different components
              involved within this. When you press the brake pedal pressurized brake fluid travels through 
              the <strong>brake pipe</strong> into the pistons of the calipers. The pistons then will <strong>force</strong> shut the caliper. The brake pads
              are fitted inside the <NuxtLink to="/brake-caliper">brake caliper</NuxtLink> and have a friction compound. When the calipers are forced shut
              via the pistons, the brake pads encounter the rotating <strong>car disc brake</strong> causing it to either slow down
              or eventually come to a stop. There are different <strong>types of brake calipers</strong> but each car has a specific
              type that fits correctly.

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">The brake pads will wear depending on your driving style and the
                  environment where you drive. If the brake pads have worn out prematurely or if you are experiencing
                  trouble under braking, it is advisable to seek the help of an expert <strong>car mechanic</strong> to investigate the
                  problem and if possible complete a <strong>full car diagnostic</strong>. If necessary, replace the brake pads as soon
                  as possible to avoid any further complications or breach safety measures.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Driving with brakes that do not function properly can, of course,
                  lead to dangerous situations on the road. You should always replace either both the front pads, both
                  the rear pads or all the pads together to ensure balanced brakes. Importantly, servicing the brake
                  pads is key to ensure that the brake system works correctly and effectively. Always service the brake
                  pads and complete the <strong>brake repair</strong> according to the guidelines set out by your car's manufacturer.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">The braking system in a car is responsible for bringing your
                  vehicle to a stop while you are driving.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Modern cars have brakes on all four wheels which are operated by a
                  hydraulic system and are made up of several components. The front brakes in a car are typically the
                  ones which play the greater part in bringing a car to stop as the weight of the car is thrown forward
                  every time the vehicle comes to a stop. There are different systems used for braking from one car to
                  the next which suits the needs of the vehicle size and function. The common hydraulic system uses
                  fluid to apply pressure to pistons in the car close to its wheels to bring the car to a halt. Some
                  cars also have power brake assistance which helps to reduce the amount of effort required to apply
                  stopping power.</p>

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Your car is a complicated machine and if you are like most people
                  who rely deeply on your car to get around. Therefore, <strong>repair and maintenance</strong> of your car can ensure
                  your personal or work life is not interrupted with any unexpected downtime or costly breakdowns. This
                  is the main reason why you need to fully understand the normal wear and tear issues and what needs
                  immediate mechanical care when it comes to your car. The braking system of your car fall into this
                  category. Drivers who overlook or ignore the early warning signs of worn-out brakes often increase
                  their cars mechanical issue which could result in risking their own safety when they continue to drive
                  whilst the problems are present. When the braking system needs attention, it can be as simple as
                  replacing your <strong>brake pads</strong> or brake shoes <strong>(drum brakes)</strong> or as complex as replacing
                  a <strong>brake master cylinder</strong> or <strong>brake servo</strong>.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">There are a variety of warning signs which indicate that your car
                  brakes need attention. Depending on the symptoms your car indicates, the actual <strong>repair and maintenance</strong>
                  required will vary. For example, vibration caused when the brakes are applied can be an indicator of a
                  few different arears of concern. This could be caused by worn brake shoes or warped <strong>brake discs</strong>, a
                  failing <strong>brake master cylinder</strong>, failing <strong>ABS pump</strong> or even malfunctioning <strong>brake calipers</strong>.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">One of the most Important warning signs of a potentially dangerous
                  braking system can be found with a malfunctioning <strong>brake pedal</strong>. This will be discovered when the brake
                  pedal fails to grab when applied, in other words the pedal has no pump or stop feeling and when
                  pressed goes all the way down to the floor. Brake pedals that collapse all the way to the floor
                  without being effective can indicate air in your brake line or <strong>brake pipes</strong>. This can happen if the
                  brake master cylinder was previously incorrectly drained and refilled with brake fluid without what
                  technically is known as bleeding the brakes. In other words, taking out the air in the braking system.
                  This can be rectified by draining the <strong>brake fluid</strong> and bleeding the brakes correctly before refilling
                  with brake fluid. If this problem does occur, it should be addressed immediately as there is no way of
                  knowing when the next potentially dangerous air bubble will prevent your car brakes from being
                  effective and working correctly when needed.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Leaking <strong>brake fluid</strong> can also be a source of your car braking system
                  problems and is usually easy to notice. Brake fluid is a clear oily substance that will normally
                  puddle up around your car tyres and can be discovered leaking from your <strong>wheel cylinder</strong>. If fluid is
                  discovered leaking from the <strong>brake master cylinder</strong>, you need to have a qualified <strong>car mechanic</strong> to
                  diagnoses reasons for the leakage and rectify the issue. Without brake fluid, your cars brake master
                  cylinder will fail to operate and so will the stopping power in your car.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Finally, the most common and obvious warning sign of faulty a
                  <strong>braking system</strong> within your car is the high pitch squeal sound when applying the brakes. The loud
                  squealing sound your brakes make when you apply them can be the final indicator that the <strong>brake pads</strong>
                  are worn out well below the three forth mark (Manufactures recommendation). Once the brake pads are
                  worn out to this thin level, a device in within your brake pads come into contact with the <strong>brake discs</strong>
                  which results in the warning squeal sound. If you are able to hear this sound in your car then this is
                  giving you the final warning that your car requires a <strong>brake service</strong>.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify"><strong>Brake repair</strong> is a section of regular car maintenance that most
                  people will only think about when their brakes have an intermittent issue or begin to weaken and fail.
                  A more experienced driver is familiar with the unusual sound of the loud squealing and squeaking
                  brakes. This could be from either their own car or listening to the sounds being transmitted from
                  other cars around them. In most cases, the squeal and squeak sounds are the first warning signs that
                  their cars braking system maybe in need of a <strong>brake service</strong>. Remarkable, in some cases, the first
                  warning sign for a necessary brake repair comes at the moment when the braking system completely fails
                  resulting in an unfortunate and unavoidable vehicle. For the more experienced and careful drivers,
                  keeping up with their <strong>car repair and maintenance</strong> and getting those brakes <strong>diagnosed</strong> and potentially
                  repaired by <strong>trained technicians</strong> is an integral part of their general maintenance routine at
                  a <strong>car repair garage</strong>.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Taking your car in for regular brake inspection 
                  and <strong>full car diagnostic</strong> comes with several benefits. The first and most important is safety. Even though the
                  squeaks and squeals may be an indicator that the braking system is faulty, in some situations,
                  problems or faults can occur with little or no warning, resulting in the cars incapability of stopping
                  or slowing down when required. Maintaining <strong>car repair services</strong> by a specialist <strong>car mechanic</strong> at regular
                  and recommended intervals, the <strong>trained technicians</strong> will be able to diagnose various braking system
                  issues before they begin to externally affect your cars ability to slowdown and stop. 
                  The <strong>vehicle repair and maintenance</strong> specialist will be able to look for specific signs of general wear and tear
                  that is caused sometimes be aggravated by adverse weather conditions which may be occurring in the
                  area you generally drive.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Correct functioning braking system is not only for your safety but
                  also other road users and pedestrians but can possible save you money on costly repairs. The braking
                  system must always be maintained and is vital for a <strong>car MOT checker</strong> when completing <strong>MOT tests</strong>.
                  <strong>Professional car services</strong> will not only complete the regular checks and the mechanic will replace the
                  <strong>brake pads</strong> if necessary, but also change the <strong>brake fluid</strong>, the <strong>brake discs</strong> and uneven linings.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Beyond safety, there are numerous benefits engaging in regular
                  brake maintenance. By having a well-documented history of <strong>repair and maintenance</strong> of your braking
                  system can be a plus point for your cars resale value when considering advertising it on the market
                  for sale. The main reason for this is the costs involved in repairing and maintaining such a complex
                  braking system can often be quite expensive and unaffordable. Majority of used car buyers will be
                  attracted to those cars which come with a well-documented history of good maintenance. Additionally,
                  by diagnosing any problems well before they get worse can result in you saving money on extra repair
                  work that could have been avoided. More importantly, regularly scheduled <strong>brake service</strong> will deliver a
                  peace of mind. Visiting Many Autos for regular <strong>repair and maintenance</strong>, will give you the confidence
                  that you can undergo a drive driving experience feeling calm, safe, and confident that your car
                  braking system is working correctly. Afterall, you cannot put a price on peace of mind!</p>

                Indications on when to replace the brake pads on your car
              </v-expansion-panel-header>
              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">The brake pads are one of the most used and replaced part on your
                  car. The question arises, why do they get replaced so often? This because they are also the most used
                  part in your car. If you think carefully, to slow down you use them, to stop at a traffic light or at
                  a crossing you use them again. Basically, you use them all the time while you are driving in whatever
                  situation you want too slow down or come to a complete stop. So, when should you get your <strong>brake pads</strong>
                  replaced? This depends on the driving habits which is very important when it comes to the lifespan of
                  your brakes. Most drivers tent stop abruptly or at the very last minute which causes your brake pads
                  to wear away faster than normal. The key to slowing and then stopping your car is to do it gradually
                  and smoothly to avoid extra pressure which helps the excessive wearing of the brake pads.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">We are living in an era where traffic has become part of our
                  everyday life. Did you know that the more you use your brakes, the shorter their lifespan? The brake
                  pads work as a clasp and every time they get used the friction material wears away.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">You can often tell when your car requires new brakes. A squealing
                  and scraping noise coming from your braking system means that something is not working correctly and
                  must be replaced. The squealing sound is caused by worn out friction surfaces rubbing or pushing
                  against the <strong>brake discs</strong>. The sounds that the car should not make include:</p>
                  <ul class="list mb-4">
                    <li>Grinding</li>
                    <li>Squealing</li>
                    <li>Screeching</li>
                    <li>Scraping</li>
                    <li>Clicking</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Please note, that any sounds the brakes make indicate that a <strong>brake pad replacement</strong> is required as a
                    perfectly working braking system is sound and noise free. If your car does not stop correctly when
                    you apply pressure on the <strong>brake pedal</strong>, then you need to make it an urgent task to have the brake
                    pads replaced. If it feels like your car is jumpy or vibrating whilst you are applying the brakes,
                    this could mean that the <strong>brake discs</strong> are warped. The brake disc are the other component that assist
                    the car to brake correctly and smoothly.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Check the brake pads regularly to make sure they are wearing out
                  below the threshold level. If they are thin and below the manufactures and <strong>MOT</strong> safety requirements,
                  this can lead to a weaker braking system that will eventually not allow the brakes to work at all.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">If your car pulls to one side when you apply the brakes, this could
                  mean that one side has worn more than the other. The car pulls to one side without the help of the
                  steering wheel. This is dangerous as you are not in control of your car and it should be able to
                  manoeuvre unless are the one enforcing it.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">You should always make sure that the brakes get checked whenever
                  you take your car in for a <strong>service</strong>. Any damage that has been done needs to be fixed immediately as
                  this can avoid any minor or major accidents.</p>
