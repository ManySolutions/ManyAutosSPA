                technicians specifically trained for this, so you know that you are getting an expert service. Our
                preferred parts for brake repairs are best quality parts only. We endeavour to fit these wherever
                possible as we believe it is important to ensure your brakes are working as well as they possibly can.
                The brakes are one of the most important parts of a car while it is a pain if the air con doesn’t work,
                and inconvenient when the engine falters or stops, you really need your brakes to be in full working
                order to avoid any nasty accidents. We’ve all heard that tell-tale screeching sound from brakes in need
                of repair, if not from our own car then from someone else’s. Other signs that your brakes need a service
                include the pedal “sinking” to the floor or feeling spongy, pulling to one side while braking or a
                grinding sound when you apply the brakes. All of these are signs that you should have your brakes
                checked as soon as possible.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">The brake pads will wear depending on your driving style and the
                  environment where you drive. If the brake pads have worn out prematurely or if you are experiencing
                  trouble under braking, it is advisable to seek the help of an expert to investigate the problem and,
                  if necessary, replace the brake pads as soon as possible.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Driving with brakes that do not function properly can, of course,
                  lead to dangerous situations on the road. You should always replace either both the front pads, both
                  the rear pads or all the pads together to ensure balanced brakes. Importantly, servicing the brake
                  pads is key to ensure that the brake system works correctly and effectively. Always service the brake
                  pads according to the guidelines set out by your car's manufacturer.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">The braking system in a car is responsible for bringing your
                  vehicle to a stop while you’re driving.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Modern cars have brakes on all four wheels which are operated by a
                  hydraulic system and are made up of several components. The front brakes in a car are typically the
                  ones which play the greater part in bringing a car to stop as the weight of the car is thrown forward
                  every time the vehicle comes to a stop. There are different systems used for braking from one car to
                  the next which suits the needs of the vehicle size and function. The common hydraulic system uses
                  fluid to apply pressure to pistons in the car close to its wheels to bring the car to a halt. Some
                  cars also have power brake assistance which helps to reduce the amount of effort required to apply
                  stopping power.</p>
