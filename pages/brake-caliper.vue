                safety hazard. If you need a replacement, we'll get you back on the road at an affordable price. A brake
                caliper is a simple yet very important component of your disc braking system. Essentially, it's the part
                that squeezes your brake pads against the surface of the rotor, creating friction that slows your car
                down. Your brakes may use floating calipers that move with the wheels, or fixed calipers that stay where
                they are. In either case, worn-out calipers can be a real danger to your ability to stop safely.
                Fortunately, they're usually very sturdy and in most cases only need to be replaced every seven to ten
                years. However, heavy braking and minor accidents may put additional wear and tear on your calipers,
                meaning they need to be replaced sooner. Looking for high-quality brake calipers we can help.</p>

                How Brake Calipers Work?

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Brake calipers are essential to your car's ability to stop and are
                  arguably one of the most important automobile brake parts. Most cars today have disc brakes, at least
                  for the front wheels, anyway. But a lot of cars and trucks are now using disc brakes in the rear, too.
                  In a disc-braking system the car's wheels are attached to metal discs, or rotors, that spin along with
                  the wheels. The job of the caliper is to slow the car's wheels by creating friction with the
                  rotors.The brake caliper fits over the rotor like a clamp. Inside each caliper is Brake calipers are a
                  vital part of your vehicle's braking system. Brake calipers squeeze the brake pads against the surface
                  of the brake rotor to slow or stop the vehicle. a pair of metal plates bonded with friction material
                  -- these are called brake pads. The outboard brake pads are on the outside of the rotors (toward the
                  curb) and the inboard brake pads on the inside (toward the vehicle). When you step on the brake, brake
                  fluid from the master cylinder creates hydraulic pressure on one or more pistons in the brake caliper,
                  forcing the pads against the rotor. The brake pads have high-friction surfaces and serve to slow the
                  rotor down or even bring it to a complete halt. When the rotor slows or stops, so does the wheel,
                  because they're attached to one another.Older cars and trucks used drum brakes, where the motion of
                  the wheels is slowed by friction between a rotating drum and brake shoes mounted inside the drum. This
                  friction caused heat and gases to build up inside the drum, which often resulted in a loss of braking
                  power known as brake fade. Because the brake pads in disc brake systems are external to the disc
                  rather than contained within a drum, they are more easily ventilated, and heat doesn't tend to build
                  up quite as fast. For this reason, drum brakes have been largely replaced in modern vehicles by disc
                  brakes; however, some less expensive cars still use drum brakes for the rear wheels, where less
                  stopping power is required. There are two main types of calipers: floating (or sliding) calipers and
                  fixed calipers. Floating calipers move in and out relative to the rotor and have one or two pistons
                  only on the inboard side of the rotor. This piston pushes the entire caliper when the brakes are
                  applied, creating friction from the brake pads on both sides of the rotor. Fixed calipers, as the name
                  implies, don't move, but rather have pistons arranged on opposing sides of the rotor. Fixed calipers
                  are generally preferred for their performance but are more expensive than the floating kind. Some
                  high-performance fixed calipers have two or more pairs of pistons (or "pots") arranged on each side of
                  the rotor -- some have as many as six pairs total. Special tools are useful when working with brake
                  calipers, especially when replacing the brake pads. We'll talk about that in the next section, and
                  then discuss the different types of brake calipers available for different types of vehicles.</p>

                Generally, you don't replace calipers in pairs, only replace the damaged side. With you may still not
                need to replace the caliper to solve your problem depending on the design. There may be a kit that comes
                with new sleeves, o-rings, and grease.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                One of the most common symptoms of a bad or failing caliper is brake fluid leakage. The calipers operate
                using brake fluid pressure from the master cylinder and pedal to extend the piston and slow the vehicle.
                A rubber seal and boot are what keeps the fluid from leaking out.

                If you have a stuck caliper, the brake pad will not completely disengage from the surface of the brake
                disc. This means you will be driving with the brakes applied slightly all the time. A major sign of a
                stuck caliper is if the vehicle pulls to one side when braking or while driving.
