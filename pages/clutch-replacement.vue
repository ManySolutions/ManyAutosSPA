                A spinning disc of heavy steel (or carbon fibre in some newer models), the flywheel stores rotational
                energy when your vehicle is at a stop. If your gears sometimes slip a malfunctioning flywheel is
                probably to blame. The flywheel is the interface between the clutch system and the engine. When your
                foot is off the clutch pedal, the clutch disc presses against the flywheel, locking the engine to the
                transmission. When you apply pressure to the clutch pedal the flywheel is released, disengaging the
                transmission from the engine. It is the amount of friction between the flywheel and the clutch plate
                that determines how much energy the clutch can hold. If the surface of the flywheel is damaged by cracks
                or grooves, or if it accumulates a build-up of oil, it will not be able to produce enough friction when
                it spins against the clutch disc, this can cause the gears to slip, which is serious safety risk for
                your vehicle engine.

                  transmission, it couples the crank shaft and flywheel to the gearbox's clutch shaft. The clutch
                  enables the drive from the engine to be disconnected momentarily from the gearbox.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">The clutch disc is simply put a friction disc that, when engaged,
                  presses against the flywheel (which is directly connected to the crankshaft) by way of the pressure
                  plate. If disengaged the clutch disc does not press against the flywheel, which in turn means that no
                  drive is transferred to the gearbox, allowing for a gear change to be made.</p>

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Many Autos operate a fleet of pool cars with a dedicated driver, so
                  wherever we are collecting from, we need to be able to leave one of our pool vehicles either in your
                  work car park / parking space, or if in a residential area, we would need to be able to leave our car
                  either at your house or on the road with a permit if required. We would be grateful if you could bear
                  this in mind when booking to use our free Collection and delivery service</p>
