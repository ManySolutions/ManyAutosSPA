              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Air Suspension systems can offer great benefits for drivers. They can
                improve ride quality. Air Suspension laity like increased ride height for off road excursions all while
                keeping the rear level under loaded conditions. But, as with other hard-working components, Air
                Suspension shocks and struts will eventually fail succumbing to either damage to or dry rot of the air
                spring. In addition, the dampener, which is just like any other shock or strut, will lose its ability to
                control the movement of the suspension due to internal wear and lose fluid inside the dampener. When an
                Air Suspension system fails, there can be up to four different options to return the vehicle to
                operating condition. Some involve repairing the existing Air Suspension system, while others involve
                replacing the system with springs and passive shocks and struts. All options have their pros and cons.
                But no matter which option is being considered.</p>

                As mentioned previously, one option is to repair the system by replacing the damaged air Suspension
                units with new units. The benefits of this option are that it restores the vehicles air suspension to
                its original condition and functionality. Cost is considered one of the downfalls of replacing the air
                Suspension units with new parts. It is highly recommended that you replace the compressor and the dryer
                assembly while doing the job to ensure that the replacement air Suspension unit will last.

                Air suspension is a modern way of enhancing the driving experience by way of computerised air vents and
                compression in the suspension system. Introduced as an improvement on the traditional steel suspension
                of luxury cars, air suspension is a feature that allows drivers to adjust the quality of the drive
                according to the nature of the surface on which they are driving. It relies on air pressure inflating
                the bellows in the suspension system to ensure that the chassis is sufficiently raised above the axle to
                mask significant bumps in the road. Due to the advanced technology involved, air suspension systems are
                more technical to fix, so it is recommended that a mechanic is consulted if your system is showing signs
                of failure. One tell-tale sign is that the vehicle appears to lean to one side when you are driving.

                Shock absorbers and coil springs help absorb and direct road force, maintaining wheel oscillation,
                jounce and rebound. The air springs are simply tough rubber and plastic bags inflated to a certain
                pressure and height to mimic the coil springs.

                Air suspension is a type of vehicle suspension powered by an electric or engine driven air pump or
                compressor. This compressor pumps the air into a flexible bellows, usually made from textile reinforced
                rubber. The air pressure inflates the bellows and raises the chassis from the axle.
