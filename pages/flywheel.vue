                efficiently store rotational energy. Flywheels resist changes in rotational speed by their moment of
                inertia. For example, flywheels are used in reciprocating engines because the active torque from the
                individual pistons is intermittent. Energy storage systems.</p>

                A dual-mass flywheel (DMF) is a rotating mechanical device that is used to provide continuous energy
                (rotational energy) in systems where the energy source is not continuous, the same way as a conventional
                flywheel acts, but damping any violent variation of torque or revolutions that could cause an unwanted
                vibration.

                The dual mass flywheel is primarily designed to reduce noise and vibration. The DMF is sort of a
                mechanical "sponge", where vibrations and harshness in the driveline are dampened by two flywheel masses
                that are connected to one another by a series of high strength springs. Any roughness is absorbed (at
                least partially) by the springs between the flywheel masses. It may help to think of a dual mass
                flywheel as a shock absorber: each flywheel is a solid connection, but between there is a "soft" spring
                that takes some of the jolt out of accelerations, gear changes, etc.

                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">A flywheel replacement is normally recommended when changing the
                  clutch. In most cases one will find that when the clutch is worn or damaged it may have affected the
                  flywheel. Not replacing the flywheel at the same time may then lead to damage to the new clutch. Hence
                  the need for a replacement at the same time, which is recommended by most mechanics.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Signs of juddering or vibrations when depressing clutch pedal are
                  normally a sign that there may be something wrong with the flywheel, especially if problems appear in
                  first gear. Apart from that, the flywheel's starter ring gear (the teeth around the out edge of the
                  plate) can get damaged due to wear. Sometimes a tooth will break, preventing the starter motor's gear
                  to grip properly leading to starting problems on the car.</p>
                <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Of course, if you suspect that you may need a flywheel replacement
                  but are not sure, it is advisable to have Many Autos assess the situation first. In any case, always
                  make sure to follow the manufacturer's guidelines.</p>

                The cost of a flywheel replacement will depend on your car and what parts the manufacturer recommends as
                being required for the replacement. In almost all occasions mechanics will advise to change the clutch
                at the same time. You could save up to 50% on your flywheel replacement versus franchise dealers with
                Many Autos.
