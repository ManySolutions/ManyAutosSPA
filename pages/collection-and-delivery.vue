              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify"> Sometimes, the worst part of getting your car fixed is having to
                bring it to the garage. We are therefore happy to offer our customers a free collection and delivery
                service If you prearrange a collection, we will pick your car up from your home or place of work and
                drive it to our premises, carry out all the necessary work (having consulted you) and deliver it back
                to you at the end of the day.</p>
              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">We are able to tow, jump start or repair your vehicle if you are
                experiencing problems or broken down for a small fee. If we can't sadly start your vehicle, we can
                contact a local recovery firm to collect your vehicle for a very competitive price.</p>

                <li>Have you got problems with getting to and from the garage? </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Here at Many Autos, we believe that we offer a valuable product
                with our Free Collection and Delivery Service, we can collect either from your place of work or from
                your home address. If you are unsure about whether the address you are considering having your vehicle
                collected from is not within our range, then please do contact us.<br></p>
              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Many Autos operate a fleet of pool cars with a dedicated driver, so
                wherever we are collecting from, we need to be able to leave one of our pool vehicles either in your
                work car park / parking space, or if in a residential area, we would need to be able to leave our car
                either at your house or on the road with a permit if required. We would be grateful if you could bear
                this in mind when booking to use our free Collection and delivery service</p>

                At present, a vehicle can simply pass, fail or receive an advisory on a specific item on the MOT test.
                So, how does the new MOT criteria for recording defects work? Here’s an explanation of the new
                categories plus some examples from the draft MOT guidance from the DVSA.

                    court of up to a maximum of £1000. A fixed penalty notice is usually the method dealt with by police
                    which costs the driver £100.</p>
