              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">The brake servo, or vacuum booster, is a small canister used to
                increase braking pressure to take the strain off the driver's foot. If a brake servo becomes damaged or
                worn it should be replaced. Using the vacuum produced by your car's engine, or special vacuum pumps, the
                brake servo boosts the natural force sent to the master cylinder when you apply pressure to the brake
                pedal. This action is commonly known as power braking. A black metal canister, the brake servo is
                located at the back of the engine compartment on the driver's side. It sits between the master cylinder
                and the pedal linkage, connecting the two by means of a rod that is attached to the master cylinder's
                piston. A valve and diaphragm system operate the brake servo, with the vacuum on either side of the
                diaphragm acting as the driving force that provides the extra braking assistance. Brake servos have
                become commonplace with the move from the drum brake to the disc brake system (at least for the
                front-axle wheels), while drum brakes produce extra power by design, disc brakes require assistance with
                this and so use brake servos to increase braking pressure.</p>

                Replacing a Brake Servo

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                If a master cylinder is leaking replace it. The cylinder is usually mounted on the bulkhead separating
                the engine and car interior. It may be fitted with a vacuum servo unit. The master cylinder is normally
                connected to the brake pedal by a pushrod. On some cars, particularly those originally designed for
                left-hand drive, it may be positioned on the nearside of the engine compartment and linked to the pedal
                by a cross rod. A leaking or faulty servo unit should also be replaced. It may be faulty if the brake
                pedal is hard to push down, and all other brake faults have been eliminated (See Bleeding the brakes).
                One-circuit cylinder. A master cylinder serving a single circuit braking system, and with no servo unit.
                Before replacing it, check the condition of the air filter, which may be causing sluggish operation. It
                should be changed every three years, 36,000 miles or 60,000 km. Before you disconnect brake lines or
                electrical leads, such as those to the stop-lamp switch or fluid-level warning light, make a sketch of
                where each fit. If the car has twin brake lines, this is vital. Tag them and mark the cylinder body
                accordingly.Be careful to note the positions of washers, bushes and pedal return springs. Check how the
                pushrod is fitted to the brake pedal - there may be more than one hole in the pedal arm.

                The brake booster is usually part of the same 'unit' as the brake master cylinder in the engine bay,
                together they transfer the pressure you put on the brake pedal to the brake units at each of the wheels.
                The vacuum system in the Brake Servo boosts the pressure you put on the brake pedal to enable lighter
                and better controlled braking motion. With good reason; brakes that do not have a Brake Servo would
                require rather well-developed leg muscles.

                Turn the engine on while pushing down lightly on the brake pedal. If your Brake Servo is not working
                correctly, then nothing will happen, or the brake pedal will push back against your foot, once the
                engine starts. This could be a sign of a Brake Servo problem or an issue with the vacuum hose.

                The brake Brake Servo is prone to deterioration, especially if there are leaks in the adjoining master
                cylinder. If you experience any problems with the brakes in a way noted under the last question it is
                advisable to have the system inspected and, if necessary, have the brake booster replaced. Servicing the
                brakes regularly is key to ensure a prolonged working life. Always service the brakes as and when
                stipulated in the guidelines set out by your car's manufacturer.

                The vacuum booster is a metal canister that contains a clever valve and a diaphragm. A rod going through
                the centre of the canister connects to the master cylinder's piston on one side and to the pedal linkage
                on the other. Another key part of the power brakes is the check valve.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                Vacuum or really lack of vacuum pressure is the most common cause of a hard brake pedal, and therefore
                the first thing to look at when a hard pedal is present. Your brake system's booster works by a series
                of diaphragms inside the booster and air on both sides of the diaphragm.

                A soft brake pedal that goes all the way to the floor can be caused by several reasons. Low brake fluid
                check for leaks underneath the car. If the booster is bad, then it will require more force on the pedal
                to stop the car. Failing master cylinder this is usually the culprit if you're not losing brake fluid.

                Some manufacturers include it in their maintenance schedules and others don't. Mercedes-Benz, for
                example, says brake fluid should be flushed and replaced with new fluid every two years or 20,000 miles.
                Volkswagen says that a brake fluid flush should be done on most of its models every two years regardless
                of mileage.
