              <p class="text-teal text-18 justify">Crankshaft converts reciprocating motion to rotational motion. It is
                how you get your car to move. If you know how an engine operates, the piston reciprocates as fuel burns
                and the gases are emitted. The piston is connected to the crankshaft via a connecting rod.</p>

                Intermittent stalling If the crankshaft position sensor or its wiring have any issues, it can cause the
                crankshaft signal to be cut off while the engine is running, which can cause the engine to stall. This
                is usually a symptom of a wiring problem, however a bad crankshaft position sensor can also produce this
                symptom.

                Symptoms of a Bad Camshaft Position Sensor. On some vehicles, a failing camshaft sensor may lock the
                transmission in a single gear until you turn off and restart the engine. If the sensor begins to fail
                while your car is moving, you may feel the car jerking while losing power. You may experience a
                noticeable loss of engine power.

                If there's a spark when the engine is cranked, it has ignition. The problem is either fuel or
                compression. RPM signal from the Crankshaft Position sensor while cranking the engine. A bad Crankshaft
                Position sensor is a common cause of no starts.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                I would just add that the purpose of the two mechanical devices is different in an internal combustion
                engine. The crankshaft is used to convert power from a piston to rotational energy. The camshaft is a
                control device. In diesel engines, a camshaft can be used to pump fuel into the cylinders.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                A broken crankshaft is not a common occurrence. Very seldom do you here of a crankshaft breaking.
                Usually a crank will break because of another failure. In an engine the amount torque created during a
                failure such as a spun bearing can cause a crank to snap.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                A crank sensor is an electronic device used in an internal combustion engine, both petrol and diesel, to
                monitor the position or rotational speed of the crankshaft. This information is used by engine
                management systems to control the fuel injection or the ignition system timing and other engine
                parameters.

                Incorrect readings will also affect fuel injection and cause your engine to sputter. Engine Stall:
                Crankshaft sensor problems can also make your engine stall at low speeds and the car will have
                difficulty while starting. In extreme cases of a failed sensor, the engine will completely fail to
                start.

              <v-expansion-panel-content eager class="card-header-body">
                The crankshaft position sensor is the most important of all engine management sensors, and the engine
                will not run without it. Many systems are smart enough to try guessing should this sensor fail and allow
                the engine to run without it. In your case, a magnetic crankshaft positioning sensor is used.
